</div>
<p class="noindent-top">Enterprise systems are composed of many different parts, with multiple technologies and numerous elements that can be less than perfect. Virtually anything designed and built will have weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Understanding where these weaknesses and vulnerabilities exist, and how to manage the security of the enterprise in spite of them, is a critically important element of a security program. This chapter examines the types and effects of various vulnerabilities in an enterprise.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Certification Objective</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter covers CompTIA Security+ exam objective 1.6: Explain the security concerns associated with various types of vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev68">Cloud-based vs. On-premises Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cloud computing has been described by pundits as computing on someone else’s computer, and to a degree there is truth in that statement. As vulnerabilities exist in all systems, then regardless of whether a system is <em>on premises</em> or <em>cloud based,</em> it will always have potential vulnerabilities. With on-premises vulnerabilities, the enterprise has unfettered access to the infrastructure elements, making the discovery and remediation of vulnerabilities a problem defined by scope and resources. With the cloud, the economies of scale and standardized environments give cloud providers an advantage in the scope and resource side of the equation. What is lacking in vulnerability management from the enterprise point of view is visibility into the infrastructure element itself, as this is under the purview of the cloud provider.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data can be stored locally on premises or remotely in the cloud. It is important to remember that no matter where data is stored, there will always be potential vulnerabilities that exist.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev69"><span id="page_100" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Zero Day</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Zero day</em> is a term used to define vulnerabilities that are newly discovered and not yet addressed by a patch. Most vulnerabilities exist in an unknown state until discovered by a researcher or developer. If a researcher or developer discovers a vulnerability but does not share the information, then this vulnerability can be exploited without the vendor’s ability to fix it, because for all practical knowledge, the issue is unknown except to the person who found it. From the time of discovery until a fix or patch is made available, the vulnerability goes by the name “zero day,” indicating that it has not been addressed yet. The most frightening thing about a zero-day threat is the unknown factor—its capability and effect on risk are unknown because it is unknown. Although there are no patches for zero-day vulnerabilities, you can use compensating controls to mitigate the risk. Security controls are covered in depth in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch31.xhtml#ch31">Chapter 31</a>, “Security Controls.”</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero-day threats have become a common topic in the news and are a likely target for exam questions. Keep in mind that defenses exist, such as compensating controls, which are controls that mitigate the risk indirectly; for example, a compensating control may block the path to the vulnerability rather than directly address the vulnerability.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev70">Weak Configurations</h3>
<p class="noindent">Most systems have significant configuration options that administrators can adjust to enable or disable functionality based on usage. When a system suffers from misconfiguration or <em>weak configuration,</em> it may not achieve all of the desired performance or security objectives. Configuring a database server to build a complete replica of all actions as a backup system can result in a system that is bogged down and not capable of proper responses when usage is high. Similarly, old options, such as support for legacy protocols, can lead to vulnerabilities. Misconfiguration can result from omissions as well, such as when the administrator does not change default credentials, which is equivalent to having no credentials at all, thus leaving the system vulnerable. This form of vulnerability provides a means for an attacker to gain entry or advance their level of privilege, and because this can happen on components with a wide span of control, such as routers and switches, in some cases an attacker can effectively gain total ownership of an enterprise.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec125">Open Permissions</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Permissions</em> is the term used to describe the range of activities permitted on an object by an actor in a system. Having properly configured permissions is one of the defenses that can be employed in the enterprise. Managing permissions can be tedious, and as the size of the enterprise grows, the scale of permissions requires automation to manage. When permissions are not properly set, the condition of <em>open permissions</em> exists. The risk associated with an open permission is context dependent, as for some items, unauthorized access leads to little or no risk, whereas in other systems it can be catastrophic. The vulnerability <span id="page_101" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>of open permissions is equivalent to no access control for an item, and this needs to be monitored in accordance with the relative risk of the element in the enterprise.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec126">Unsecure Root Accounts</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Unsecure root accounts</em> are like leaving master keys to the enterprise outside on the curb. Root accounts have access to everything and the ability to do virtually any activity on a network. All root accounts should be monitored, and all accesses should be verified as correct. One method of protecting high-value accounts such as root accounts is through access control vaults, where credentials are checked out before use. This prevents unauthorized activity using these accounts.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong configurations include secure root (Linux) and Administrator (Windows) accounts. Without securing these accounts, anything they are connected to, including processes and services, is exposed to vulnerabilities.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec127">Errors</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Errors</em> are the condition where something has gone wrong. Every system will experience errors, and the key to managing this condition is in establishing error trapping and responses. How a system handles errors is everything, because unhandled errors are eventually handled at some level, and the higher up through a system an error goes, the less likely it will be handled correctly. One of the biggest weaknesses exploited by attackers is improper input validations. Whether against a program input, an API, or any other interface, inserting bad information that causes an error and forces a program into a non-normal operating state can result in an exploitable vulnerability. Trapping and handling errors can reduce the possibility of an error becoming exploitable.</p>
<p class="indent">Errors should be trapped by the program and appropriate log files generated. For example, web server logs include common error logs, customized logs, and W3C logs. W3C logs are web server logs that focus on recording specific web-related events. The Windows System log records operating system error messages. Windows can be configured to log records of success and failure of login attempts and other audited events. The Windows Application log records events related to local system applications.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec128">Weak Encryption</h4>
<p class="noindent">Cryptographic errors come from several common causes. One typical mistake is choosing to develop your own cryptographic algorithm. Development of a secure cryptographic algorithm is far from an easy task, and even when it’s attempted by experts, weaknesses can be discovered that make the algorithm unusable. Cryptographic algorithms become trusted only after years of scrutiny and repelling attacks, so any new algorithms would take years to join the trusted set. If you instead decide to rely on secret algorithms, be warned that secret or proprietary algorithms have never provided the desired level of protection. A similar mistake to attempting to develop your own cryptographic algorithm <span id="page_102" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>is attempting to write your own implementation of a known cryptographic algorithm. Errors in coding implementations are common and lead to weak implementations of secure algorithms that are vulnerable to bypass. Do not fall prey to creating a weak implementation; instead, use a proven, vetted cryptographic library.</p>
<p class="indent">The second major cause of cryptographic weakness, or <em>weak encryption,</em> is the employment of deprecated or weak cryptographic algorithms. Weak cipher suites are those that at one time were considered secure but are no longer considered secure. As the ability to use ever faster hardware has enabled attackers to defeat some cryptographic methods, the older, weaker methods have been replaced by newer, stronger ones. Failure to use the newer, stronger methods can result in weakness. A common example of this is SSL; all versions of SSL are now considered deprecated and should not be used. Everyone should switch their systems to TLS-based solutions.</p>
<p class="indent">The impact of cryptographic failures is fairly easy to understand: whatever protection that was provided is no longer there, even if it is essential for the security of the system.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec129">Unsecure Protocols</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another important weak configuration to guard against in the enterprise is <em>unsecure protocols</em>. One of the most common protocols used, HTTP, is by its own nature unsecure. Adding TLS to HTTP, using HTTPS, is a simple configuration change that should be enforced everywhere. But what about all the other protocol stacks that come prebuilt in OSs and are just waiting to become a vulnerability, such as FTP, Telnet, and SNMP? Improperly secured communication protocols and services and unsecure credentials increase the risk of unauthorized access to the enterprise Network infrastructure devices can include routers, switches, access points, gateways, proxies, and firewalls. When infrastructure systems are deployed, these devices remain online for years, and many of them are rarely rebooted, patched, or upgraded.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec130">Default Settings</h4>
<p class="noindent">Default settings can be a security risk unless they were created with security in mind. Older operating systems used to have everything enabled by default. Old versions of some systems had hidden administrator accounts, and Microsoft’s SQL Server used to have a blank system administrator password by default. Today, most vendors have cleaned these issues up, setting default values with security in mind. But when you instantiate something in your enterprise, it is then yours. Therefore, you should make the settings what you need and only what you need, and you should create these settings as the default configuration baseline. This way, the settings and their security implications are understood. Not taking these steps leaves too many unknowns within an enterprise.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec131">Open Ports and Services</h4>
<p class="noindent">For a service to respond to a request, its port must be open for communication. Having <em>open ports</em> is like having doors in a building. Even a bank vault has a door. Having excess <em>open services</em> only leads to pathways into your systems that must be protected. Disabling unnecessary services, closing ports, and using firewalls to prevent communications except <span id="page_103" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>on approved channels creates a barrier to entry by unauthorized users. Many services run with elevated privileges by default, and malware takes advantage of this. Security professionals should make every effort to audit services and disable any that aren’t required.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak configurations greatly increase the likelihood of successful attacks and infiltration. Make every effort to remove unnecessary apps, disable any unnecessary services, change default account usernames and passwords, and close or secure unnecessary ports.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev71">Third-Party Risks</h3>
<p class="noindent">The enterprise computing environment is full of third parties, and their risks become enterprise risks. Common <em>third-party risks</em> that are often overlooked are issues of vendor management, system integration, and lack of vendor support. These are all related in the fact that when you chose a vendor as part of your enterprise solution, it made sense. But over time, enterprises change, vendors change, capabilities and needs change, and what was once a good fit might not be at a future point in time. Keeping systems optimized is not a simple task, and many times later conditions will result in different decisions with regard to third parties and their risks.</p>
<p class="indent">Supply chains seldom stop with the next hop, and in technology those chains can be long and complex. With these supply chains comes risk from elements such as outsourced code development, maintenance of systems, and, in the world of cloud systems, data storage on another party’s computer.</p>
<p class="indent">With respect to third-party software running in the enterprise, it is important to have an inventory of what the software is, by version, and where it is used. This assists the security team in monitoring sources for vulnerabilities through sources like the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. This list will also help in determining risk levels as software reaches its end of life or end of service life.</p>
<p class="indent">Additional policy-related issues associated with third-party risk management are covered in detail later in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch33.xhtml#ch33">Chapter 33</a>, “Organizational Policies.”</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that supply chain concerns and lack of vendor support are concerns directly related to third-party risks and management.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec132">Vendor Management</h4>
<p class="noindent">A vendor or supplier is a firm that has a business relationship with the enterprise. In most cases, this relationship in the enterprise is one of many customers. While the voice of the customer is important, the voice of a single customer is almost never heard. The challenge of <em>vendor management</em> is one of determining one’s own needs and then finding the vendors that offer the best value proposition against those needs. This is more than just selecting and buying a product for most components in an enterprise; issues of support, system lifetime, and maintenance all play a role in the long-term value of a vendor <span id="page_104" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>and their products. Mapping the needs and managing the multidimensional problem of determining the best fit and then maintaining that relationship over time is essential in the ever-changing enterprise environment.</p>
<h5 class="h5">System Integration</h5>
<p class="noindent">Enterprises are composed of many different components that all work together to process the information that flows through the enterprise. Different components serve different functions, but in the end, they have to work together. <em>System integration</em> is the connecting of these components, each representing a portion of the system into a complete functioning unit. System integration is an area where vulnerabilities can exist, as the pieces can have gaps in their integration or capabilities that do not manifest per the desired specification. System integration is coupled with configuration management because the configurations of the individual pieces can affect how the system as a whole functions. Any deviations from design specifications represent an opportunity for risk.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Lack of Vendor Support</h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Lack of vendor support</em> can become an issue at several different levels. The most obvious scenario is when the original manufacturer of the item, be it hardware or software, no longer offers support. When an item reaches its end of life (EOL) from the original manufacturer’s standpoint, this signifies the finality of its life under almost all circumstances. After the manufacturer stops supporting an item, options to keep it up to date with patches and fixes seldom exist. At this point, an organization that continues to use the product assumes all of the risk associated with issues uncovered after the product has entered EOL status, and the options to address these risks are limited to compensating controls.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be confused! <em>End of life (EOL)</em> is the term used to denote that something has reached the end of its “useful life.” <em>End of service life (EOSL)</em> or <em>end of support</em> is when the manufacturer quits selling an item. In most cases, the manufacturer no longer provides maintenance services or updates.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Another scenario in which lack of vendor support arises is when the system in question is implemented by a third-party vendor and that vendor either no longer supports the configuration or is no longer in business. The underlying technology may still be supported by the original manufacturers, but the lack of support for the middleware provided by the third-party implementer raises questions as to whether the underlying products can be updated or patched. This places the testing burden on the end user, and in many cases the end user does not have the knowledge or skills necessary to conduct thorough regression testing.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A system can have vulnerabilities related to its age. Whether the system is composed of old parts, as in an embedded system, or has become an end-of-life legacy system, the lack of vendor support can result in the owner’s inability to address many newly discovered issues.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec133"><span id="page_105" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Supply Chain</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Supply chain</em> risk is caused by vulnerabilities that lie within the supply chain. Whether these vulnerabilities are in the actual supply chain itself or a product coming from a third party, the results are the same—a level of increased risk. As we saw in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, global supply chains can be interrupted by external events that then go on to cause issues for firms that depend on the supply chain functioning efficiently. Delays of product launches, updates, and milestones can all occur when parts, components, or software elements are not delivered on time.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A supply chain attack typically occurs at the weakest security link in the supply chain, and this is common during the manufacturing process or even in the product delivery phase.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec134">Outsourced Code Development</h4>
<p class="noindent">Code can be one of the greatest sources of vulnerabilities and risk in an enterprise. Code is embedded in so many aspects of the enterprise—from the equipment to the business processes, from the applications that make things run to the infrastructure it all runs on. Code is the glue that holds it all together. However, when code is buried in the processes, and that code was developed by a third party, often using third-party code fragments, the chain of risk becomes long and difficult to manage. The risk isn’t just in the fact that the code is outsourced, but actually in the fact that the visibility and control over these risks becomes harder to manage with every step away from the source.</p>
<p class="indent">Creating code that is both maintainable and secure is not a simple task. It is important to have conditions in contracts requiring appropriate development measures be in place for third-party code, including the rights to inspect and verify security functionality. Items such as backdoors, either placed intentionally or left from a testing process, typically require access to the source code to find and remove. Ensuring third-party developers have appropriately secure coding practices and having their code reviewed by independent testers and placed in escrow for safekeeping are considered best practices.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec135">Data Storage</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Data storage</em> is an important aspect of every enterprise, and it is typically distributed throughout the enterprise in different capacities and configurations. If all data was in a single location, then data storage management, including backup and recovery functions, would be easy to manage. As data storage is distributed across the enterprise into multiple enclaves with differing requirements and criticalities, the management of data storage becomes more difficult. Ensuring the correct access controls and security protections, such as backups, is important for all data stores, and when gaps in these controls emerge, this creates vulnerabilities. If attackers can manipulate data stores, then they can affect enterprise operations. To ensure all data is protected from becoming a vulnerability to the system, having a standardized data storage policy and checklist is good practice in the enterprise. Elements can be varied based on criticality of the data store, but following a standard procedure will reduce the chances of gaps existing from oversight or errors.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev72"><span id="page_106" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Improper or Weak Patch Management</h3>
<p class="noindent">All systems need patches periodically as errors and vulnerabilities are discovered and vendors issue software fixes to these vulnerabilities. One of the important takeaways from patching is that once a supplier patches their software, hackers can reverse engineer the vulnerability from the patch. Therefore, once the patch is released, attackers learn where to attack. To manage the risk associated with patch management vulnerabilities, it is important to establish a strong patch management program that covers all systems and all software. The literature of security failures is full of examples where the missing of a system or two was all it took for an attacker to get into the system. Having an <em>improper or weak patch management</em> system is an open invitation to having vulnerabilities exploited. This makes patch management one of the essential security controls and one where there should be no excuses as to why it was not implemented.</p>
<p class="indent">To minimize the risks associated with applying patches to production systems, it is recommended that the enterprise change control process be used. Because patches can be time sensitive, it is important to have defined periods of time when patches must be installed as well as an automated means of determining what patches are needed, where they are needed, and status of the current patch level by target location.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec136">Firmware</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Firmware</em> is just another form of software with one noted distinction: it is stored in hardware to be present when the system boots up. However, it is still software, with all the baggage of software—bugs, vulnerabilities, patch requirements, updates, and so on. With firmware being part of the system itself, always present, it is frequently missed when considering how to keep software up to date. This goes for manufacturers as well. If you are looking at a system that has firmware, reasonable questions to ask as part of your research before selection include: How is the firmware updated? How often? And how are updates distributed? The lifecycle, vulnerabilities, and maintenance issues associated with firmware mirror those of software. Patching firmware is an often-neglected issue, and this can lead to vulnerabilities, especially given the typical lifetime of some equipment.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Updates and patching are used to ensure software and firmware are up to date and secure. Manufacturers of hardware often provide updates for firmware, and it is the organization’s responsibility to ensure firmware updates are applied.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec137">Operating System (OS)</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Operating system (OS)</em> patch management was a chore years ago, with patches coming haphazardly over time, each requiring manual intervention. Today, major operating systems can patch themselves, and with a little automation, the tracking and management of patches is easy. There are only a couple of steps to get this right. First, have a patch management policy, and make it patch everything and track all patches. Second, follow up on that policy. There are excuses about not being able to patch for a wide range of reasons, but a properly executed patch management strategy overcomes all of those risks. <span id="page_107" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Worried about a patch breaking a crucial system? If it is a crucial system, you have more than one, right? Patch one system, test to see if it still works, and then patch the rest.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of enterprises that missed a patch that then became the pathway for an attacker is long. Attackers have it easy when it comes to testing whether you have patched—they try to exploit the known vulnerability, and if it works, they know you haven’t patched and they have gained access.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec138">Applications</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Applications</em> are the programs that comprise the functional aspect of the enterprise. From server-based elements such as web servers and database servers, to desktop applications like Microsoft Office, applications are the tools that handle the data and add value to the system. Applications, like all software, require updating and patching to fix vulnerabilities and bugs. The challenge with application patching across an enterprise is in the tracking of all of the applications used, including even small, seemingly meaningless programs that are installed on desktops. Not only does the enterprise have to keep track of all the applications it has, but it has to determine which ones have updates and when. Some major software vendors make this process easy, but the myriad of additional vendors make the task of knowing what needs updating, when and where, a real challenge. There are applications designed to manage this aspect, and it is highly recommended that enterprises use patch-tracking software that can identify when patches are available and install them.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of a security professional’s responsibilities is to keep up with current Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and update or patch systems to keep the enterprise environment secure. This applies to firmware, operating systems, applications, virtual machines, and devices.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev73">Legacy Platforms</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Legacy platforms</em> is the term used to describe systems that are no longer being marketed or supported. They are also considered old, which in IT terms can be as little as a few years. Legacy systems represent an interesting vulnerability because, by being in the legacy category, they are no longer supported, so if new problems are discovered, the only fix is a compensating control. Having systems that can’t be patched is a risk, but like all risks, it must be measured and weighed against the costs of change. In a properly architected secure environment, the risk of legacy vulnerabilities is partially covered by the compensating controls that make executing those vulnerabilities extremely hard if not impossible.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev74">Impacts</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Impacts</em> are the resulting effects of a risk that is realized. Impacts are the items that an organization is attempting to avoid with a security incident. Impacts can be categorized <span id="page_108" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>in several different groups, and these are described in the sections that follow. Risk management implications of impacts are covered in detail in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch34.xhtml#ch34">Chapter 34</a>, “Risk Management.” For details on risk and impact, the material in that chapter works together with the following items.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec139">Data Loss</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Data loss</em> is when an organization actually loses information. Files can be deleted, overwritten, or even misplaced. Ransomware is the most dangerous form of data loss because it is driven by outside forces and its very nature is to make the data unavailable to the enterprise until a ransom is paid. Hardware failure is another source of data loss. The primary defense for data loss is a solid backup program that can restore lost data.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec140">Data Breaches</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Data breaches</em> are the release of data to unauthorized parties. Attackers that infiltrate a system are frequently looking to steal information such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, corporate data with value on the open market, and intellectual property. Having a data breach can be a legal issue, a financial issue, a reputation issue, or any combination of these issues, depending on the type and scope of the breach. Strong access controls, encryption of data at rest, and data loss prevention (DLP) elements can lessen the impact. Encryption is the strongest control because a breach of encrypted data without the key isn’t actually a breach.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec141">Data Exfiltration</h4>
<p class="noindent">Data is a unique asset in many ways. One of the more relevant ways it is unique is in the fact that it can be copied, and then stolen, without affecting the original data. Stealing data becomes an exercise in data exfiltration or taking the copy out of the enterprise. Just as when a thief steals anything, the true theft only occurs when they escape with the item. <em>Data exfiltration</em> is the exporting of stolen data from an enterprise. Data exfiltration impact is related to the data being stolen. If it is intellectual property, then the impact can be directly to the bottom line. Loss of intellectual property can result in loss of future sales.</p>
<p class="indent">The loss of customer data can have impacts to reputation as well as direct financial impacts via regulatory penalties. Major data breaches have cost companies hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties, fines, and court settlements.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec142">Identity Theft</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Identity theft</em> is a crime where someone uses information on another party to impersonate them. This is a secondary impact once data is exfiltrated. The loss of data can come from commercial systems and even home systems, and the results are the same: people can lose money, property, and time cleaning up an identity theft claim. The impact of data exfiltration that includes personally identifiable information (PII) can be significant <span id="page_109" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>in terms of regulatory costs. Recent major breaches have had substantial regulatory fines and legal costs associated with the loss of PII. The most expensive type of record to lose was customer PII records, which were involved in around 80 percent of breaches in the Verizon breach report. This is not just a big company financial issue. With the average cost of each lost record being roughly $150, it makes even small breaches of 1000 records a potential problem for smaller businesses.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec143">Financial</h4>
<p class="noindent">At the end of the day, risk is measured in <em>financial</em> terms, and the impact from vulnerabilities can be expressed in financial terms as well. While it is sometimes difficult to directly trace each issue to a financial figure, there have been numerous examples where the results are easy to connect to the financials. A German steel mill was destroyed by attackers, Sony lost a movie release to North Korean hackers, Equifax paid out nearly $2 billion in response to its 2017 breach—these are all costs that are easily attributed to the direct impact of a cyber attack.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s a list of items that can contribute to the financial costs of a cyber attack:</p>
<p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs associated with investigating and fixing enterprise systems</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost orders/revenue due to system downtime</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fines for regulatory noncompliance on privacy laws</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorney fees from lawsuits</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ransom payments made for ransomware</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Losses due to stolen intellectual property</p>
<p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share price decline and market capitalization loss</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the financial numbers seen in the press are skewed by the large settlements of big companies with big losses, but the effect on small to medium-sized enterprises is even more dramatic. An average cybersecurity loss can cost a small to medium-sized business $400,000. For many businesses, that number is large enough to destroy them.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec144">Reputation</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Reputation</em> impact as a result of a cyber attack comes in two main forms: loss of customer confidence and, in cases where skilled workforce is involved, a competitive field loss of key employees. If your customer base has questions about your ability to fulfill orders and manage their information, or just has a general loss of confidence in company management, then your customers may go to a competitor. This is true of businesses that have consumer-based customers as well as businesses with corporate-based customers.</p>
<p class="indent">Companies that have highly skilled workforce members who are in short supply also have to be concerned with their reputation in the eyes of their employees. After all, who wants to work for a company that embarrasses them due to news stories about management <span id="page_110" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>failures that result in cybersecurity losses? Every tech worker wants Google or Apple on their resume, but no one in cybersecurity wants to talk about working for a firm like Equifax, where mismanagement of IT resources caused one of the costliest breaches in history. Having workers quit because they don’t trust their company and finding replacements for highly skilled personnel when the company is in a reputational crisis is not a position management ever wants to find itself in.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec145">Availability Loss</h4>
<p class="noindent">The CIA triad is confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Availability is defined as resources being available for authorized users when they are supposed to be available. When the impact of a cyber attack affects infrastructure elements, either by system damage, data loss, or loss of systems during recovery efforts, the effect is one that results in the loss of system capability. If this loss in capability is high enough, the system will stop processing records. For some firms, this is survivable for relatively short periods of time. For others, the downtime translates directly into lost revenue, and in some cases costs associated with service level agreements (SLAs) being broken. The loss of availability on the part of any system will have an impact on the enterprise; otherwise, why have the system? Determining the actual scale of an availability loss is simple in some transactional systems and more complicated in others, but at the end of the day, a firm invests business resources into its IT systems to facilitate business operations, not interrupt them.</p>

<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch6ans1" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch6.xhtml#r_ch6ans1">1</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A, B, and D.</strong> System integration, supply chain, and vendor management are sources of third-party risk. Financial management is related to impacts, not mainly third-party risks.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch6ans2" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch6.xhtml#r_ch6ans2">2</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A and D.</strong> Improper or weak patch management and weak configurations are defined as common sources for vulnerabilities.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch6ans3" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch6.xhtml#r_ch6ans3">3</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A and D.</strong> Having open ports and using unsecure protocols can both provide openings for attackers to get into a system. Lack of vendor support is a third-party risk, and firmware has a fixed configuration.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch6ans4" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch6.xhtml#r_ch6ans4">4</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A, B, C, and D.</strong> A good patch management process should include automated management of software assets, automated verification of current patch levels, a specified period by which systems should be patched, and connection of the patch management process to the change control process.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch6ans5" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch6.xhtml#r_ch6ans5">5</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A and C.</strong> Regulatory fines and penalties as well as lost income because of downtime are direct financial impacts of cybersecurity problems. Business reputation may lead to a loss of customers, but this is not a direct connection. Loss of data may or may not have a financial impact depending upon the data and its connection to revenue.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch6ans6" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch6.xhtml#r_ch6ans6">6</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B.</strong> A zero-day attack exploits system and application vulnerabilities that are unknown to others except the person who found it. The other answer options are not attack types. Vulnerabilities can exist on premises or be cloud based, and legacy platforms is the term used to describe systems that are no longer being marketed or supported.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch6ans7" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch6.xhtml#r_ch6ans7">7</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A, B, and C.</strong> Every effort should be made to remove unnecessary apps, disable any unnecessary services, and change default account usernames and passwords. Opening all ports is a recipe for disaster. Unnecessary or unused ports should be closed or secured.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch6ans8" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch6.xhtml#r_ch6ans8">8</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D.</strong> All versions of SSL are now considered deprecated and should not be used. Everyone should switch their systems to TLS-based solutions. All other statements are true.</p>

The manufacturer is in fact most often the vendor, and from their standpoint, the product reaches EOL when they stop supporting it. The supply chain manager is a distractor answer choice.</p>
<p class="ques1"><strong><a id="ch6ans10" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch6.xhtml#r_ch6ans10">10</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C.</strong> Data exfiltration is the exporting of stolen data from an enterprise. Data loss is when an organization actually loses information. Data breaches are the release of data to unauthorized parties.
