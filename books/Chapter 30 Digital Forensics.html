<p class="noindent-top">Computer forensics is certainly a popular buzzword in computer security. The term <em>forensics</em> relates to the application of scientific knowledge to legal problems. Specifically, computer forensics involves the preservation, identification, documentation, and interpretation of computer data. In many cases, digital forensics is the technical side of developing proof as to what happened or didn’t happen as part of an incident response effort. Digital forensics specifically uses scientific principles to provide assurance in explaining what digital evidence tells you about what either has or hasn’t happened with a computer system.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Certification Objective</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter covers CompTIA Security+ exam objective 4.5: Explain the key aspects of digital forensics.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev295">Documentation/Evidence</h3>
<p class="noindent">All evidence is not created equal. Some evidence is stronger and better than other, weaker evidence. Several types of evidence can be germane:</p>
<p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Direct evidence</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral testimony that proves a specific fact (such as an eyewitness’s statement). The knowledge of the facts is obtained through the five senses of the witness, with no inferences or presumptions.</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Real evidence</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also known as associative or physical evidence, this includes tangible objects that prove or disprove a fact. Physical evidence links the suspect to the scene of a crime.</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Documentary evidence</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence in the form of business records, printouts, manuals, and the like. Much of the evidence relating to computer crimes is documentary evidence.</p>
<p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Demonstrative evidence</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Used to aid the jury and can be in the form of a model, experiment, chart, and so on, offered to prove that an event occurred.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_548" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>A wide range of items can be considered documentation and evidence in an investigation. This chapter examines some of the common types one would run across in a forensics examination and the issues associated with each.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec744">Legal Hold</h4>
<p class="noindent">In the U.S. legal system, legal precedent requires that potentially relevant information be preserved at the instant a party “reasonably anticipates” litigation or another type of formal dispute. Although this sounds technical, it is fairly easy to grasp: once an organization is aware that it needs to preserve evidence for a court case, it must do so. The mechanism is fairly simple as well: once you realize your organization needs to preserve evidence, you must use a <em>legal hold,</em> or litigation hold, which is the process by which you properly preserve any and all digital evidence related to a potential case. This event is usually triggered by one organization issuing a litigation hold request to another. Once an organization receives this notice, it is required to maintain a complete set of unaltered data, including metadata, of any and all information related to the issue causing the litigation hold. This means that ordinary data retention policies no longer are sufficient, and that even alterations to metadata can be considered to be a violation of the hold request. If a judge determines that a violation of a hold request may materially affect the ability of a jury to make a decision, the judge can instruct the jury to consider the act as hiding evidence. Major jury awards have been decided based on failure to retain information, as failure to comply can be seen as negligence.</p>
<p class="indent">Where does the information subject to a legal hold reside? Everywhere, including e-mail, office documents (electronic and paper), network shares, mobile phones, tablets, databases—everywhere the information is shared, all copies need to be produced unaltered, even if relevant documents were created years ago. Finding and managing all of this information falls under a branch of digital forensics called e-discovery, which deals with the identification, management, and preservation of digital information that is subject to legal hold. The time to prepare for a legal hold situation is before the event occurs because it will take time to create the necessary policies and procedures and make them effective via appropriate awareness training.</p>

<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the consequences of legal hold on record retention is testable, and legal holds supersede any standard corporate policy or procedure.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec745">Video</h4>
<p class="noindent">A convenient method of capturing significant information at the time of collection is video capture. Videos allow high-bandwidth data collection that can show what was connected to what, how things were laid out, desktops, and so forth. A picture can be worth a thousand words, so take the time to document everything with pictures. Pictures of serial numbers and network and USB connections can prove invaluable later in the forensics process. Complete documentation is a must in every forensics process, and photographs can assist greatly in capturing details that would otherwise take a long time and be prone to transcription error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_549" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Another source of video data is in the closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras that are used for security, both in industry and, in growing numbers, homes. Like all other digital information, CCTV video can be copied and manipulated and needs to be preserved in the same manner as other digital information.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A digital camera is great for recording a scene and information. Screenshots of active monitor images may be obtained as well. Pictures can detail elements such as serial number plates, machines, drives, cables connections, and more. A photograph is truly worth a thousand words.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Another aspect associated with videos in today’s smartphone-dominated world, where millions of videos are captured every day and uploaded to social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and so on, is the legal ramifications of such evidence streams. Add the ability to do AI-generated deep fakes, and the need to validate these “evidence” sources has become a real thing in digital forensics.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec746">Admissibility</h4>
<p class="noindent">For evidence to be credible, especially if it will be used in court proceedings or in corporate disciplinary actions that could be challenged legally, it must meet three standards:</p>
<p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Sufficient evidence</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence must be convincing or measure up without question.</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Competent evidence</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence must be legally qualified and reliable.</p>
<p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Relevant evidence</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence must be material to the case or have a bearing on the matter at hand.</p>
<p class="indent">For materials to meet these standards for <em>admissibility,</em> it is incumbent that proper procedures are followed at all stages during collection, processing, and analysis. An item officially becomes evidence in a legal proceeding when a judge determines that it is admissible. Three rules guide a judge’s determination of whether to admit an item into evidence:</p>
<p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Best evidence rule</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Courts prefer original evidence rather than a copy, to ensure that no alteration of the evidence (whether intentional or unintentional) has occurred. In some instances, an evidence duplicate can be accepted, such as when the original is lost or destroyed by a natural disaster or in the normal course of business. A duplicate is also acceptable when a third party beyond the court’s subpoena power possesses the original. Copies of digital records, where proof of integrity is provided, can in many cases be used in court.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence rules exist at the federal and state levels and vary. Digital evidence is not always considered a “writing” and is not always subject to the best evidence rule.</p>
</div>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="page_550" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><strong>Exclusionary rule</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution precludes unreasonable search and seizure. Therefore, any evidence collected in violation of the Fourth Amendment is not admissible as evidence. Additionally, if evidence is collected in violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) or other related violations of the U.S. Code, or other statutes, it may not be admissible to a court. For example, if no policy exists regarding the company’s intent to monitor network traffic or systems electronically, or if such a policy exists but employees have not been asked to acknowledge it by signing an agreement, sniffing employees’ network traffic could be a violation of the ECPA.</p>
<p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Hearsay rule</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearsay is secondhand evidence—evidence offered by the witness that is not based on the personal knowledge of the witness but is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Hearsay is inadmissible unless it falls under one of the many recognized exceptions (such as those delineated in FRE 803). Typically, computer-generated evidence is considered hearsay evidence, as the maker of the evidence (the computer) cannot be interrogated. Exceptions are being made where items such as logs and headers (computer-generated materials) are being accepted in court. Computer evidence is typically brought into a case by an expert witness who can speak for the data and what it means.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws mentioned here are U.S. laws. Other countries and jurisdictions may have similar laws that would need to be considered in a similar manner.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec747">Chain of Custody</h4>
<p class="noindent">After evidence is collected, it must be properly controlled to prevent tampering. The chain of custody accounts for all persons who handled or had access to the evidence. More specifically, the <em>chain of custody</em> shows who obtained the evidence, when and where it was obtained, where it was stored, and who had control or possession of the evidence for the entire time since the evidence was obtained. Any and all access to the evidence is recorded.</p>
<p class="indent">The following are the critical steps in a chain of custody:</p>
<p class="listt"><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Record each item collected as evidence.</p>
<p class="list"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Record who collected the evidence along with the date and time it was collected or recorded.</p>
<p class="list"><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write a description of the evidence in the documentation.</p>
<p class="list"><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the evidence in containers and tag the containers with the case number, the name of the person who collected it, and the date and time it was collected or put in the container.</p>
<p class="list"><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Record all message digest (hash) values in the documentation.</p>
<p class="list"><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="page_551" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Securely transport the evidence to a protected storage facility.</p>
<p class="list"><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain a signature from the person who accepts the evidence at this storage facility.</p>
<p class="list"><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide controls to prevent access to and compromise of the evidence while it is being stored.</p>
<p class="listb"><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securely transport the evidence to court for proceedings.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never analyze the seized evidence directly. The original evidence must be secured and protected with a chain of custody. It should never be subjected to a forensic examination because of the fragile nature of digital evidence. A forensic copy, however, can be examined and, if something goes wrong, discarded, and the copy process can be repeated. A good forensics process will prove that the forensic copy is identical to the original at the start and at the end of the examination. From a practical standpoint, investigators usually make multiple forensic copies and perform their analysis in parallel on the multiple copies.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec748">Timelines of Sequence of Events</h4>
<p class="noindent">Digital forensic investigations begin with a scope, a charge of what is of interest to be investigated. In a modern computer environment, asking for everything that happened is a scope that is impossible to fulfill, for just booting up a machine can result in hundreds of events, in literally seconds. Once a scope is defined, it inevitably includes a time element, typically something in the order of the following: between a beginning date and time and ending date and time, for user XYZ, examine with respect to (insert whatever is of interest here, be it keywords, specific types of actions, and so on). With this information as boundaries, it is common to produce a <em>timeline of specific events</em> that fall within the scope and time boundaries. This timeline will have the specifics, including the metadata to document it, demonstrating the sequence of events as recorded by the computer. The sequence can be very important because it provides key clues as to what actually happened, even when there is not a direct artifact. For instance, if the first time a USB drive was attached is after a file was last touched, and metadata is available in the registry, then that file is probably not being transported on the USB. User logins and logoffs also help determine sequencing and operations. If a user is accused of doing transaction X on a network resource at a specific time and date, but their PC shows they were not logged in, then either they used another machine or there is something else happening, such as a hijacked account. Building a timeline of activities from multiple perspectives can provide a lot of useful information as to what did happen, what could have happened, and what makes no sense (more data is needed).</p>
<h5 class="h5">Timestamps</h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Timestamps</em> are metadata entries associated with artifacts in a computer system. While a log entry may have a timestamp, some items can have multiple timestamps, stored in multiple locations. In NTFS, there are three common file times (Creation, Modification, <span id="page_552" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Accessed) and one metadata time (MFT Change). These four timestamps are stored in two places: one with the $File_Name attribute and one with $Standard_Info. And if that isn’t enough confusion, the two different attributes are updated differently, meaning they may differ. This is important to forensic investigations because timestamps can be changed on systems, and this can lead to erroneous conclusions. Tampering with timestamps is challenging given that most tools do not handle all timestamps in the same way, which can lead to evidence of tampering.</p>
<p class="indent">Time is measured differently in Linux and Windows. Linux uses the concept of Epoch time—the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT), not counting leap seconds. It is stored as a signed 32-bit number, enabling times before January 1, 1970, as well as after. The system clock has a resolution of a second, although there are timer elements that allow down to nanosecond timing measurements. Microsoft Windows uses a 64-bit value that represents the elapsed time since 12:00 A.M. January 1, 1601 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), with a resolution of 100-nanosecond intervals. Note that both systems use UTC as a base, and most storage of time elements is done in UTC, with conversions to local time happening upon reading a value.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the challenges for all timestamp usage is inconsistency in the OS in keeping values up to date. While Microsoft Windows has a plethora of different timestamps to look at, there is great inconsistency on many of these values being updated by the OS or an application. The primary reason for this revolves around performance, as most timestamps are mere artifacts and are not important in many standard OS functions. Not maintaining the timestamps, or not maintaining all copies of timestamps, can improve performance of some operations.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Time Offset</h5>
<p class="noindent">Record <em>time offset</em> is the difference in time between the system clock and the actual time. Computers keep their own internal time, but to minimize record time offset, most computers sync their time over the Internet with an official time source. Files and events logged on a computer will have timestamp markings that are based on the clock time on the machine itself. It is a mistake to assume that this clock is accurate. To allow the correlation of timestamp data from records inside the computer with any external event, it is necessary to know any time offset between the machine clock and the actual time. When collecting forensic data it is vitally important to collect the record time offset so that local variations in time can be corrected.</p>
<p class="indent">Another form of time offset is the difference between local time zones and UTC. As discussed earlier, with most time records being in UTC, conversion to local time zones may be necessary to make sense of some records.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever one is using time, whether timestamps, log times, or comparison to actual calendars, it is important to synchronize all records to the same offset. Many logs use local time. Comparing local time and UTC time will result in errors, except for the GMT time zone, where the local time is UTC. Know what your times are with respect to the zones before use.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><span id="page_553" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding time elements for forensics is important. Pay attention to time zones and the specific details in the question.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec749">Tags</h4>
<p class="noindent">As previously discussed, a chain-of-custody document records all accesses to evidence from time of collection until destruction. But how does one refer to a specific piece of evidence, especially if it is hardware containing data, such as a USB drive? This is done though tags. Physical serialized <em>tags</em> are attached to each item, and the tag number is used to identify a specific item. Frequently the items are then stored in anti-static bags to protect them from damage.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec750">Reports</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Reports</em> are the official descriptions of the forensic data. Reports can have a variety of elements—from pure descriptive information, such as machine/device identifiers (make, model and serial number), to information on the data, including size and hash values. Reports can also have specific elements that are derived from this information, such as a timeline, an analysis of keywords, specific artifacts, and present or missing items. An expert can opine on what these elements mean or can mean with respect to the system. For instance, if timestamps are significantly different, the expert may note (opine) that the difference exists. From a professional perspective, it is important for the forensics investigator to stick to just what the information can show and not try to add commentary. For example, if the timestamp data has been tampered with, this is a provable fact. However, opining on who did it is more speculation and may result in the expert being called out on this in court. Experts who stray from the provable can be struck by the judge, and being stricken from a case is a black mark that will call into question one’s opinions now and in the future. As such, reports tend to be very sanitized, and the lawyers add the color of the case later.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec751">Event Logs</h4>
<p class="noindent">Ideally, you should minimize the scope of logging so that when you have to search logs, the event you are interested in stands out without being hidden in a sea of irrelevant log items. Before a problem occurs, if as part of the preparation phase the organization limits logging to specific events, such as copying sensitive files, then later, if questions arise as to whether the event happened or not, a log file exists to provide the information. When you have an idea of what information you will want to be able to examine, you can make an active logging plan that ensures the information is logged when it occurs, and if at all possible in a location that prevents alteration. <em>Active logging</em> is determined during preparation, and when it comes time for recovery, the advance planning pays off in the production of evidence. Strategic intelligence gathering, covered later in the chapter, can provide the information necessary to build an effective active logging plan.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec752"><span id="page_554" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Interviews</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember that witness credibility is extremely important. It is easy to imagine how quickly credibility can be damaged if the witness can’t answer affirmatively when asked, “Did you lock the file system?” Or, when asked, “When you imaged this disk drive, did you use a new system?”, the witness can’t answer that the destination disk was new or had been completely formatted using a low-level format before data was copied to it. Witness preparation can be critical in a case, even for technical experts.</p>
<p class="indent">As human memory is not as long lasting as computer files, it is important to get witness testimony and collect that data as early as possible. Having them write down what they remember immediately is very helpful in preserving memory.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The different elements under documentation/evidence work together, not as separate entities. Be sure to understand what the question is specifically asking for when you choose the answer, as several answers may be connected to the correct one, but one will be the principal component.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev296">Acquisition</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Acquisition</em> refers to the collection of information that may be evidence in an investigation. Evidence consists of the documents, verbal statements, and material objects admissible in a court of law. Evidence is critical to convincing management, juries, judges, or other authorities that a particular event has occurred. It is vitally important to document all the steps taken in the collection of evidence, as these may be challenged in court and the processes followed as evidenced by the documentation will be all that can be used to demonstrate the veracity of the processes. The steps involved in acquisition are important, as the consequences of the failure to follow proper procedures may not be immediately apparent and may not be repairable after the fact.</p>
<p class="indent">The collection, storage, and submission of evidence is challenging, but it is even more challenging when computers are used because the people involved may not be technically educated and thus may not fully understand what has happened. Keep these points in mind as you collect evidence:</p>
<p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who collected the evidence?</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was it collected?</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was it collected?</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has had possession of it?</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was it protected and stored?</p>
<p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When was it removed from storage? Why? Who took possession?</p>
<p class="indent">Computer evidence presents yet more challenges, because the data itself cannot be identified with the physical senses—that is, you can see printed characters, but you can’t see the bits where that data is stored. Bits of data are merely magnetic pulses on a disk or <span id="page_555" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>some other storage technology. Therefore, data must always be evaluated through some kind of “filter” rather than sensed directly. This is often of concern to auditors, because good auditing techniques recommend accessing the original data or a version as close as possible to the original data. What’s more, any filtering, if necessary, should not change the meaning of the data.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec753">Order of Volatility</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are many sources of data in a computer system, and if the machine is running, some of these sources are volatile. Items such as the state of the CPU and its registers, RAM, and even storage are always changing, which can make the collection of electronic data a difficult and delicate task. These elements tend to change at different rates, and you should pay attention to the <em>order of volatility,</em> or lifetime of the data, so that you can prioritize your collection efforts after a security incident to ensure you don’t lose valuable forensic evidence. In some cases, you may have only one chance to collect volatile data, after which it becomes lost forever.</p>
<p class="indent">Following is the order of volatility of digital information in a system:</p>
<p class="listt"><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU, cache, and register contents (collect first)</p>
<p class="list"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Routing tables, ARP cache, process tables, kernel statistics</p>
<p class="list"><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live network connections and data flows</p>
<p class="list"><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memory (RAM)</p>
<p class="list"><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary file system/swap space</p>
<p class="list"><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data on hard disk</p>
<p class="list"><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remotely logged data</p>
<p class="list"><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data stored on archival media/backups (collect last)</p>

<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the order of volatility of digital information in a system is a testable item—commit it to memory.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Failure to pay attention to the order of volatility during data collection will result in data loss, and once lost, the data is gone forever in many of the categories.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common data element needed later in the forensics process is an accurate system time with respect to an accurate external time source. A record time offset is calculated by measuring system time with an external clock such as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. The offset between system time and true time can be lost if the system is powered down, so it is best to collect it while the system is still running.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec754"><span id="page_556" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Disk</h4>
<p class="noindent">When collecting digital evidence, it is important to use proper techniques and tools. Some of the key elements are the use of write blockers when making forensic copies, hashing and verifying hash matches, documenting handling and storage, and protecting media from environmental change factors. Of particular note is that the data present on a system can be a function of both the file system and the hardware being employed. A physical hard disk drive (HDD) will persist data longer than a solid state drive (SSD). And the newer file systems with journaling and shadow copies can have longer persistence of information than older systems such as File Allocation Table–based (FAT-based) systems. Raw disk blocks can be recovered in some file systems long after data has been rewritten or erased, due to the nature of how the file systems manage the data.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec755">Random-Access Memory (RAM)</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Random-access memory (RAM)</em> is the working memory of the computer that handles the current data and programs being processed by the CPU. This memory, once limited to a single megabyte, now commonly consists of 4 GB or more. This memory holds the current state of the system as it is processing and is continuously changing. There are cases of malware that exists only in RAM, and without memory analysis and forensics, you would never see it. But this information is lost forever when the system is powered down.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec756">Swap/Pagefile</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>swap</em> or <em>pagefile</em> is a structure on a system’s disk to provide temporary storage for memory needs that exceed a system’s RAM capacity. The operating system has provisions to manage the RAM and pagefile, keeping in RAM what is immediately needed and moving excess to the pagefile when RAM is full. This causes a performance hit, and with the reasonable cost of RAM, most systems avoid this by having sufficient RAM. Capturing the pagefile (pagefile.sys stored by default in C:\pagefile.sys) in a forensics investigation is important any time the RAM is captured, as it is an extension of the RAM.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec757">Operating System (OS)</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>OS,</em> or operating system, is a base computer program that acts as the manager of all activity on a system. The OS is the source of many forensic artifacts, most of which are created to enhance system responsiveness to user requests. The two major OSs, Microsoft Windows and Linux, perform basically the same tasks: they enable applications to perform on a system. How they function, what artifacts are generated, all the technical details relevant to a forensics investigation, are different and thus require separate and specialized treatment with respect to the OS.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec758">Device</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the most common <em>device</em> acquisitions is USB storage devices. These devices are used to transport files between machines and are common in any case where the removal of information is suspected. A number of artifacts can be tied to USB device usage on a <span id="page_557" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>system, including when it was connected, link files and prefetch items on the drive, and who was logged in to the machine at the time of use.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec759">Firmware</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Firmware</em> is a set of software that is associated with a physical device. Firmware exists for almost every electronic device, not just computers; for example, firmware exists for USB devices. Firmware can be of interest in a forensics investigation when the malfunctioning of a device is an issue, as malware has targeted the firmware. As such, it takes a very specialized set of tools and equipment to analyze the firmware, as it is not readily accessible to outside users.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec760">Snapshot</h4>
<p class="noindent">A <em>snapshot,</em> as you can easily guess, is a picture of a particular moment in time. Snapshots are common in virtual machines, providing a point in time to which the machine can be recovered. Operating systems also have adopted this technology for some of their information, using point-in-time recovery to assist in fixing problems from updates or changes to the system. This capturing of points in time can be useful to a forensic investigator because it allows a means of looking at specific content at an earlier point in time. The scope of what is covered by a snapshot can vary between different systems, and this may limit usefulness.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec761">Cache</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Caches</em> are temporary storage locations for commonly used items and are designed to speed up processing. Cashes exist all over in computer systems and are performance-enhancing items. Caches exist for files, for memory, for artifacts; they exist for fast retrieval of items that the OS expects. As such, they are inherently relevant to a specific activity that has been done and is likely to be done again and can serve as evidence of specific activities that have been done. An example of this would be an artifact such as a prefetch record of a file, indicating that the user that is logged in has previously opened that file.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec762">Network</h4>
<p class="noindent">An important source of information in an investigation can be the network activity associated with a device. There can be a lot of useful information in the network logs associated with network infrastructure. The level and breadth of this information is determined by the scope of the investigation. While the best data would be from a live network forensic collection process, in most cases this type of data will not be available. There are many other sources of network forensic data, including firewall and IDS logs, network flow data, and event logs on key servers and services.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec763">Artifacts</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Artifacts</em> are the key element in modern digital forensics. Most of the items used to demonstrate a specific action as occurring fall into one of two categories: metadata or <span id="page_558" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>OS artifacts. Metadata examples include registry entries, timestamps, and sizes. OS artifacts include prefetch files, jump list artifacts such as most frequently used (MFU) and most recently used (MRU), shell bags, and link files. The metadata artifacts are items that the OS uses to perform its duties, while most of the OS artifacts are related to improving performance. Keeping a cache of links to the most recently used files will speed up activity if the user returns to previous work, which is a common task. Also, deletion of the work (a file) does not delete the associated artifacts. Hence, artifacts can live on after a file is gone, leaving proof that the file existed.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artifacts are the principal data element used in forensics. They are connected to how the computer manages data to perform a task. Be sure to choose the correct artifact that’s specifically and directly related to the question, not peripherally.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev297">On-premises vs. Cloud</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cloud has become a resource for enterprise IT systems, and as such it is intimately involved in both e-discovery and forensics. Having data that may or may not be directly accessed by the tools of e-discovery and forensics can complicate the needed processes. An additional complication is the legal issues associated with the contracts between the organization and the cloud provider. As both forensics and e-discovery are secondary processes from a business perspective, they may or may not be addressed in a standard cloud agreement. Because these processes can become important—and if they do, it may be too late to contractually address them—it behooves an organization to prepare by addressing them in cloud agreements with third parties.</p>
<p class="indent">The issues associated with <em>on-premises versus cloud</em> with respect to forensics is one dominated by access. When storage or computing is happening on another party’s computing platform, as in the cloud, whether physically at another site or on premises, access is governed by the contracts and agreements covering the relationship.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec764">Right to Audit Clauses</h4>
<p class="noindent">Audits are the mechanism used to verify that systems are performing to their designed levels of purpose, security, and efficiency. The ability to audit involves access to a system and the data. When the information is stored or processed in the cloud, users need the ability to audit the cloud provider. The level and scope of the audit can vary given the dynamic natures of both the cloud and the regulatory environment, but one thing does not vary. The only rights the customer has are detailed in the service level agreements/contracts with the cloud provider. This makes the <em>Right to Audit clause</em> a critical requirement of any service level agreement, and its specificity needs to match the operational and regulatory scope of the cloud engagement.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec765"><span id="page_559" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Regulatory/Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whether on premises or in the cloud, there will be cases where regulatory or law enforcement actions raise jurisdictional issues. If you have your software development data in the cloud, and the servers/storage elements are in a foreign country, whose laws will apply? It is important to consult with the company’s legal counsel to understand the ramifications of data location with respect to forensics and subsequent data use.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec766">Data Breach Notification Laws</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Data breach notification laws</em> are covered in detail in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch35.xhtml#ch35">Chapter 35</a>, “Privacy,” but are worthy of mention in our discussion of forensics because the discovery of a breach can occur during a forensic examination. Many forensic investigations are related to the theft of intellectual property, and many times that is also a breach of data protected under privacy laws.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev298">Integrity</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Integrity</em> is a very important concept in security because it refers to the veracity of a data element. Has there been an unauthorized change to an element, or can one trust its current value? This works well as a concept, but how is this actually instantiated in a system? It is done through the use of cryptographic hashes, checksums, and data provenance. Managing these elements relies on other system functions, but if one can authenticate where a data element came from (provenance) and that it remains unchanged (hash value), then one can assume its integrity is intact.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec767">Hashing</h4>
<p class="noindent">If files, logs, and other information are going to be captured and used for evidence, you need to ensure that the data isn’t modified. In most cases, a tool that implements a hashing algorithm to create message digests is used.</p>
<p class="indent">A <em>hashing algorithm</em> performs a function similar to the familiar parity bits, checksum, or cyclic redundancy check (CRC). It applies mathematical operations to a data stream (or file) to calculate some number that is unique based on the information contained in the data stream (or file). If a subsequent hash created on the same data stream results in a different hash value, it usually means that the data stream was changed.</p>
<p class="indent">The mathematics behind hashing algorithms has been researched extensively, and although it is possible that two different data streams could produce the same message digest, it is very improbable. This is an area of cryptography that has been rigorously reviewed, and the mathematics behind Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is very sound. In 2005, weaknesses were discovered in the MD5 and SHA algorithms, leading the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to announce a competition to find a new cryptographic hashing algorithm, which was named SHA-3. SHA-3 has been adopted by NIST in 2015 and has a different internal structure <span id="page_560" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>from its predecessors, making it more robust. Although MD5 is still used, best practice would be to use the SHA-2 series, and SHA-3 once it becomes integrated into tools.</p>
<p class="indent">The hash tool is applied to each file or log and the message digest value is noted in the investigation documentation. It is a good practice to write the logs to a write-once media such as a CD-ROM. If the case actually goes to trial, the investigator may need to run the tool on the files or logs again to show that they have not been altered in any way.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of files stored on today’s hard drives can be very large—literally hundreds of thousands of files. Obviously, this is far too many for the investigator to analyze. However, by matching the message digests for files installed by the most popular software products to the message digests of the files on the drive being analyzed, the investigator can avoid analyzing approximately 90 percent of the files because he can assume they are unmodified. The National Software Reference Library (NSRL) collects software from various sources and incorporates file profiles into a Reference Data Set (RDS) available for download as a service (see <a href="http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/">www.nsrl.nist.gov</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hashing is used throughout digital forensics to measure integrity between copies of data. Checksums do not have the specificity of hashes, so hashes are the primary tool.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec768">Checksums</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Checksums</em> are mathematical algorithms that produce a check digit based on an incoming stream. Designed for error testing across small data sets, they have advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that for error checking, they are fast and can detect a single-bit error. A disadvantage is that they miss larger numbers of errors as a second error can cancel the effect of the first on a checksum. Thus, checksums serve no real purpose in digital forensics. If two checksums are different, the incoming data streams are different. If the checksums are the same, you might still have different data streams.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec769">Provenance</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Provenance</em> is a reference to the origin of data. In the case of digital forensics, it is not enough to present a specific data element as “proof”; one must also show where it came from. Provenance is specific, as in where on a file structure and where on a device; in most cases, there will be multiple representations, as in the file structure with respect to where a file resides and with respect to the OS (logical) and its location on a physical drive in sectors (physical). Provenance involves metadata, which can include timestamps, access control information, and a host of other data that can assist in determining which user did which action at what time with respect to the object. In most cases, there is not a single location for this evidence; like the timeline, it must be constructed from several different artifacts.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev299"><span id="page_561" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Preservation</h3>
<p class="noindent">When information or objects are presented to management or admitted to court to support a claim, that information or those objects can be considered as evidence or documentation supporting your investigative efforts. Senior management will always ask a lot of questions—second- and third-order questions that you need to be able to answer quickly. Likewise, in a court, credibility is critical. Therefore, evidence must be properly acquired, identified, protected against tampering, transported, and stored.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the key elements in preservation is to ensure nothing changes as a result of data collection. If a machine is off, do not turn it on—the disk drives can be imaged with the machine off. Turning on the machine causes a lot of processes to run and data elements to be changed. When making a forensic copy of a disk, always use a write blocker, as this prevents any changes on the media being imaged. Normal copying leaves traces and changes behind, and a write blocker prevents these alterations.</p>
<p class="indent">Digital evidence has one huge, glaring issue: it can change and not leave a record of the change. The fact that the outcome of a case can hinge on information that can be argued as not being static makes the act of preservation a crucial element in determining the veracity of evidence. From the initial step in the forensics process, the most important issue must always be <em>preservation</em> of the data. There is no recovery from data that has been changed, so from the beginning of the collection process, safeguards must be in place. There are several key steps that assist the forensic investigator in avoiding data spoilage. First, when data is collected, a solid chain of custody is maintained until the case is completed and the materials are released or destroyed. Second, when a forensic copy of the data is obtained, a hash is collected as well, to allow for the verification of integrity. All analysis is done on forensic copies of the original data collection, not the master copy itself. Also, each copy is verified before and after testing by comparing hash values to the original set to demonstrate integrity.</p>
<p class="indent">This process adds a lot of work, and time, to an investigation, but it yields one crucial element—repudiation of any claim that the data was changed, tampered, or damaged in any way. Should a hash value vary, the action is simple: discard the copy, make a new copy, and begin again. This process shows the courts two key things: process rigor to protect the integrity of the data, and traceability via hash values to demonstrate the integrity of the data and the analysis results derived from the data.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding not only the importance of data preservation but the process of ensuring it uses hash values is a very testable concept.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev300">E-Discovery</h3>
<p class="noindent">Electronic discovery, or <em>e-discovery,</em> is the term used for the document and data production requirements as part of legal discovery in civil litigation. When a civil lawsuit is filed, under court approval, a firm can be compelled to turn over specific data from systems <span id="page_562" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>pursuant to the legal issue at hand. Electronic information is considered to be the same as paper documents in some respects and completely different in others. The evidentiary value can be identical. The fragility can be substantial—electronic records can be changed without leaving a trace. Electronic documents can also have metadata associated with the documents, such as who edited the document, previous version information, and more.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the pressing challenges in today’s enterprise record store is the maintenance of the volumes of electronic information. Keeping track of the information stores based on a wide range of search terms is essential to comply with e-discovery requests. It is common for systems to use forensic processes and tools to perform e-discovery searches.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev301">Data Recovery</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Recovery</em> in a digital forensics sense is associated with determining the relevant information for the issue at hand—simply stated, recover the evidence associated with an act. But what if the act is not precisely known? For example, suppose a sales manager for a company quits and goes to work with a competitor. Because she is a sales manager, she has had access to sensitive information that would benefit the new employer. But how do you know whether she took sensitive information with her? And even if she did, how do you determine for purposes of recovery which information she took, and where to look for it? Since forensics software has yet to invent a “Find Evidence” button, and there is no field in any computer protocol to tell investigators this is the data they are looking for, the act of recovering the necessary information can be a significant challenge. With today’s multiterabyte drives, the volumes of data can be daunting.</p>
<p class="indent">Handing a forensic investigator a 1TB drive and saying, “Tell me everything that happened on this machine,” is tantamount to giving the investigator a never-ending task. The number of events, files, and processes that occur as a normal part of computing leads to literally thousands of events for every logon–work–logoff cycle. This is not a problem of finding a needle in a haystack; it’s a problem of finding a needle in the hay fields of Kansas! There are ways to trim the work: establishing timelines within which the suspected activity occurred; identifying keywords to find strings of information that make a record relevant; and, perhaps the most powerful for building a solid data set, pinpointing specific activities that have associated logs of their occurrence. The latter strategy is associated with the idea of active logging, discussed in the earlier “Event Logs” section.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev302">Nonrepudiation</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Nonrepudiation</em> is a characteristic that refers to the inability to deny an action has taken place. This can be a very important issue in transactions via computers that involve money or things of value. Did the transaction occur and did the parties involved actually do it? These are the core questions of nonrepudiation. Using cryptographic elements to establish identity and credentials, along with hash values to establish integrity, the appropriate combinations can yield results that can only happen if the parties are actually involved and the event took place. Designing and creating systems that enable <span id="page_563" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>this characteristic are essential elements of trusted systems used in financial and other transactions. Similar details can be achieved via analysis of certain activity on systems combining successful logins and subsequent activity. The only question is whether or not the credentials are still secure. This can be a legitimate question because attackers steal credentials all the time and reuse them.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonrepudiation is an important security concept. In fact, it is listed in two separate exam objectives. Remember, it refers to the inability to deny an action has taken place. Digital signatures, the use of multiple authentication factors, and even audit trails by IP address are examples of nonrepudiation and prove or disprove that something has happened.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev303">Strategic Intelligence/Counterintelligence</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Strategic intelligence gathering</em> is the use of all resources to make determinations. This can make a large difference in whether or not a firm is prepared for threats. The same idea fits into digital forensics. Strategic intelligence can provide information that limits the scope of an investigation to a manageable level. If we have an idea of specific acts for which we would like to have demonstrable evidence of either occurrence or nonoccurrence, we can build a strategic intelligence data set on the information. Where it is, what it is, and what is allowed/not allowed are all pieces of information that, when arranged and analyzed, can lead to a data-logging plan to help support forensic event capture. Other events, such as adding data-wiping programs and then removing them, are important to consider. The list of possibilities is long, but just like strategic threat intelligence, it is manageable, and by working in concert with other firms and professionals, and not in isolation, a meaningful plan can emerge.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Counterintelligence gathering</em> is the gathering of information specifically targeting the strategic intelligence effort of another entity. Knowing what people are looking at and what information they are obtaining can provide information into their motives and potential future actions. Making and using a tool so that it does not leave specific traces of where, when, or on what it was used is a form of counterintelligence gathering in action.</p>

<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch30ans2" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch30.xhtml#r_ch30ans2">2</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A.</strong> Record time offset will be lost if the system is powered down, so it is best collected while the system is still running.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch30ans3" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch30.xhtml#r_ch30ans3">3</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B.</strong> The chain of custody accounts for all persons who handled or had access to the evidence.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch30ans4" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch30.xhtml#r_ch30ans4">4</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D.</strong> <em>Sufficient evidence</em> states the evidence must be convincing or measure up without question. <em>Direct evidence</em> is oral testimony that proves a specific fact (such as an eyewitness’s statement). The knowledge of the facts is obtained through the five senses of the witness, with no inferences or presumptions. <em>Competent evidence</em> states the evidence must be legally qualified and reliable. <em>Relevant evidence</em> states the evidence must be material to the case or have a bearing on the matter at hand.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch30ans5" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch30.xhtml#r_ch30ans5">5</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C.</strong> You should continue archiving all e-mail. You must continue to comply with the court order. Letting legal make determinations when the order specifies “all e-mail” is a mistake. Making copies of the e-mail is only legit if you make forensically secure copies, not just backups.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch30ans6" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch30.xhtml#r_ch30ans6">6</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B.</strong> <em>Real evidence</em> is also known as associative or physical evidence and includes tangible objects that prove or disprove a fact. Physical evidence links the suspect to the scene of a crime. <em>Direct evidence</em> is oral testimony that proves a specific fact (such as an eyewitness’s statement). The knowledge of the facts is obtained through the five senses of the witness, with no inferences or presumptions. Evidence in the form of business records, printouts, manuals, and similar objects, which make up much of the evidence relating to computer crimes, is <em>documentary evidence. Demonstrative evidence</em> is used to aid the jury and can be in the form of a model, experiment, chart, and so on, offered to prove that an event occurred.</p>

<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch30ans8" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch30.xhtml#r_ch30ans8">8</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C.</strong> A system image is a dump of the physical memory of a computer system and would not be captured in a video. All of the others are static sources of information that a capture video is valuable in recording.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch30ans9" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch30.xhtml#r_ch30ans9">9</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D.</strong> A hashing algorithm performs a function similar to the familiar parity bits, checksum, or cyclic redundancy check (CRC). It applies mathematical operations to a data stream (or file) to calculate some number that is unique based on the information contained in the data stream (or file).</p>
<p class="ques1"><strong><a id="ch30ans10" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch30.xhtml#r_ch30ans10">10</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A.</strong> While all of these are important, from the initial step in the forensics process, the most important issue must always be preservation of the data.<span id="page_568" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>
