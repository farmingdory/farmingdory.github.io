While each has its pros and cons, release methods such as DevOps can support a more secure method of delivering software. If you are not familiar with DevOps, it is a set of practices that bring together development and operations to deliver software in an efficient manner.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998635"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-callout-head">Definition</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> Microsoft defines </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentcalibre21">DevOps</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> as a compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops). DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998651"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">What has been historically the case for software development and release is that there is a product team, a development team, a testing team, and an operational team that all take part in the delivery of features and products to a production environment. This is typically done in a way where each team has gates that start and finish their part of the process. DevOps intends to streamline that process and reduce or eliminate the hand-offs between teams. Most organizations will accomplish this by creating a single team that owns not just the development of the code, but the testing and delivery as well. In some smaller organizations, there may only be a few people on the team who do all of these activities themselves; in larger organizations, specialists would be used to perform specific tasks within the team. For instance, in these larger teams, there would be one or more people focused solely on the deployment, or just the testing, as well as having developers focused on the code. However, in all of these cases, the team would share the work items as one team.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998692"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">DevOps is primarily a function of automation, tooling, and processes. This model works best when there is little to no manual work or processes. Some of the most successful organizations that use a DevOps model are able to deploy code from a development environment to a production environment in minutes. And they can do this multiple times a day. To achieve this level of speed and confidence, the organization will build a </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">CI/CD pipeline</span><a name="marker-1008349"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">.</span><a name="marker-1008362"></a></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998709"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-callout-head">Definition</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> A </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentcalibre21">CI/CD pipeline</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> is where code is continuously integrated (CI) using an integration tool like Jenkins, and continuously delivered or deployed (CD) using deployment tools like Octopus or Ansible. Code is built into packages that are automatically pushed to a production environment (continuously deployed) or could require a manual step to push code to production (continuously delivered).</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998722"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The confidence in deployment is built in through strong controls around how source code is tracked, merged, and versioned. Testing must occur all throughout this model, from the developer’s unit test at the lowest level, up to the testing of API integration and system testing. Lastly, monitoring of the application in production for potential issues and having a rapid feedback loop to the development team will reduce the time to fix issues as they are found. This gives greater confidence to the development team that they can deploy and fix code rapidly. This certainly enables the developer to feel empowered, but where does security fit?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998733"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-callout-head">Note</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> There needs to be a clarification between DevOps and CI/CD.

As an application security person myself, this makes me happy. This means that if the developer has the right information and knows how to resolve a vulnerability, then they can fix a vulnerability and have it running in production in a short period of time—maybe even within a day! But getting to this point requires a few things to be in place and working well.

Similar to choosing the right security controls that align to the actual risk it is attempting to protect, the right release methodology needs to be in line with the organization’s goals. If you are an organization that needs to release software multiple times a day like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, or Google do, then a DevOps model works well. If you are an organization that requires more strict control over your code releases, like a health care or critical infrastructure organization, a Lean or Waterfall methodology may work better. The important takeaway with these different methods is that every organization approaches their release cycle differently. In fact, in many organizations, they will not follow just one approach across the organization and may even combine different ones to gain efficiency. For example, some teams may follow a DevOps model while others are Lean, and others may use a CI model while working in a Waterfall methodology. I will describe these methodologies next.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-999082"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">4.2.1 Waterfall</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999094"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Waterfall </span><a name="marker-1008560"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">is a </span><a name="marker-1008573"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">methodology that depends on each part of the process acting as a checkpoint where formal sign-off must be achieved before the next part of the process can begin.

The release could have been a monthly, quarterly, or even a biannual release. These releases tend to be large with many features, hence the heavy process to ensure that everything is accounted for and production-ready. However, in this process, there is typically a part of the development team that is needed to manage the incoming production defects. They process these defects and push fixes to production in something like a fix pack, but still with the proper oversight of a </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">change control</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> entity</span><a name="marker-1008651"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> that ensures that changes are properly considered by an audience of stakeholders.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999305"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Security in Waterfall is handled primarily through two avenues. One is through the methodology itself during the requirements gathering, the design phase, and the testing phase where the security team or tools within the organization will impose security. Some of the requirements that are pressed may be part of regulatory, compliance, or contractual needs. New security technology will also be required by the security team if it provides better protection for the organization. The security tools that are either integrated with the development environment or during the testing phase will uncover different security issues that will be treated as defects where they will be triaged, assigned, and resolved.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999347"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The second way that security makes it into the Waterfall methodology is through the support path. If a vulnerability is found in production, the support team will typically be alerted and will be required to triage and resolve it in a fix release. This is true for not only issues that may be reported by external parties, like clients, but also for issues that are discovered when components that are used in the application become vulnerable. This can happen when a weakness is discovered in something like the web server or a parsing library that has a newly discovered vulnerability that needs to be resolved quickly. Waiting for the next release cycle for a critical or high vulnerability to be resolved is unlikely to win over any fans.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999373"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Although Waterfall can create latency in the process of releasing software, the lines for injecting security in the process are pretty clear.

Agile is also able to adapt to changes without impacting the delivery of software, hence the name. Unlike Waterfall, which requires a more structured approach to intake new requirements, Agile allows for changes to be integrated in a short period of time. If the development organization is using something like Scrum in their Agile methodology, the development team would work in sprints that are a short burst of work over 2, 3, or 4 weeks. The goal in a sprint is to complete some minimal viable product by the end of that sprint that can be delivered to a client. In most cases, a 2-week time period for code release will not provide enough time to release a large change, but a small viable proof of concept on a feature is possible. This can then be delivered to an environment for clients to “touch and feel” and provide their feedback.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999491"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The development team that works in an Agile methodology is typically small, and tends to be cross-functional, or full-stack, where the team has ownership of all components of the application development and deployment.

Similar to the DevOps methodology, Agile allows for quick development and deployment of fixes for security vulnerabilities. These found vulnerabilities can be triaged by the application security team, presented to the Scrum team for prioritization, and worked in a future sprint. This means that, in theory, a fix for a security issue could be in production within a few weeks; shorter if the issue is severe enough. Where there are some potential issues is getting security vulnerabilities prioritized and understood by the development team and the product owners. There will almost always be pushback, especially when time frames are short and client features need to go out. However, similar to Waterfall, the Agile team may have a separate Scrum team that is responsible for resolving defects found in production and potentially picking up security issues as well. When there is a separate work stream like this, it allows the development to continue unimpeded while support and security work would be merged into the development branch or released as its own fix </span><a name="marker-1008716"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">pack.</span><a name="marker-1008729"></a></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-999744"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">4.2.3 Lean</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999756"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Lean </span><a name="marker-1008742"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">has </span><a name="marker-1008755"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">been in practice for decades, going back to the early automobile assembly lines in order to streamline processes, optimize people and resources, and more importantly eliminate waste.

Security involves many different aspects, including application, infrastructure, and business risk. Because these aspects are so vast, identifying and prioritizing the security risks have become more complex and manual. In the Lean world, this may amount to potential waste and rework. Lean in application security should be used to unblock security processes and procedures and insert security into the software development life cycle. This is accomplished by aligning security practices into software development that will increase participation and reduce rework by incorporating security requirements and practices during requirements, analysis, and design phases. In addition, Lean in security includes establishing security monitoring and continuous improvements as the product evolves and matures through the software development life cycle.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000149"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">One important callout related to Lean in application security is that it works well with other software development methodologies such as DevOps and Agile, considering that Lean is an approach that looks for continuous process improvement. As mentioned with other methodologies, the tools that are used elsewhere to provide security are still applicable here. Threat modeling, code reviews, test automation, and monitoring are all still needed to provide assurance that security is baked into the product when it is delivered to the customer. The major difference is the focus on a “test and learn” approach that attempts to continuously review the security processes in each stage in order to understand where improvements should be made. An example of this would be in the case of threat modeling. When performing a threat model, regardless of the methodology, it’s important to validate that the model is accurate. After a recently completed threat model for an application, it may be found that through validation, a control that was assumed to be present was not. In this case, the security team and the development team will review their threat modeling process and develop better process documentation, as well as ensure that the appropriate stakeholders are included in the threat modeling </span><a name="marker-1008781"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">process.</span><a name="marker-1008794"></a></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-1000188"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">4.2.4 DevOps supports security better</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000200"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">DevSecOps</span><a name="marker-1008807"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">, </span><a name="marker-1008820"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">SecDev</span><a name="marker-1008846"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">Ops</span><a name="marker-1008833"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">, </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">DevOps with security</span><span class="css-zv7ju9">, it’s been called many things.

Vulnerabilities are being released at a rapid pace, and they are becoming easier to exploit. This means that in order to stay ahead of significant issues, application security needs to be able to move swiftly as well. With this in mind, the methodology that the engineering organization has decided to use matters. For instance, in the Waterfall methodology, waiting possibly weeks or even months to release a resolution to a found vulnerability would leave the organization exposed much longer than necessary. Even in an Agile organization, a fix might be weeks away. Pretty fast, but not fast enough for an attacker who might already have code that exploits a CVE that was just publicly released. Attackers today can take information from a CVE and turn it into an exploit within hours.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000355"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">This is where a methodology like DevSecOps can support the rapid deployment of security fixes (figure 4.5).

If everything goes well in the CI/CD and there were no found vulnerabilities with the developed code, that still doesn’t mean that a third-party library that is used by the application would always be secure. Additionally, as infrastructure is today being set up and configured as code, called infrastructure as code (IaC</span><a name="marker-1008911"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">), there is a unique opportunity to apply a consistent approach to secure infrastructure, but in order to do this, the organization needs to have a method of monitoring for configuration drift.

They’re not as up to speed as Superior Products, and although they are using an Agile methodology, their releases are only deployed to production once every 4 weeks. They are still relying on a SAST tool that only runs once the code has been checked into their code repository and the continuous integration engine picks up the changes. Furthermore, the development team has decided not to trigger a failed build when vulnerabilities are found due to the timeline commitments to get code deployed at the end of the 4-week sprint. This means that code is built with vulnerabilities identified and is then deployed to a testing environment with the known vulnerabilities. Acme Services has decided to partner with their internal penetration testing team to run a penetration test prior to the final build package being completed. This ultimately means that vulnerabilities are discovered late with the intention of queuing up the vulnerabilities that are found into the next sprint and subsequent release.

If you ever listen in on a conversation between a developer of an application and a person responsible for the deployment and operation of that application, you will hear two different voices on how the application actually works. The operational resource will have a much different perspective on how the application is actually used by end users. Chances are, they will see the application being used in creative ways that were not considered by the developer or even the application security team. This is the power of threat modeling in DevSecOps. Identifying potential flaws with those that understand how the product works, and can be broken, will improve the quality and security of the application when the design decisions are being made.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000817"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">One of the hurdles with threat modeling in the DevSecOps methodology is that it does not react well to slow processes. As I described in previous chapters, threat modeling can be done through a manual process with a whiteboard and subject matter experts or through a tool such as Microsoft’s Threat Modeling Tool. Neither of these can feasibly be used in an environment where releases are happening multiple times a day. This means that threat modeling has to occur at a higher level during design and architecture decisions when requirements can be outlined and integrated.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000832"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">To complete a threat model in the DevSecOps methodology, the team will engage in the same threat modeling process as in any other methodology. This means that during the design phase, while requirements are being determined, the subject matter experts will gather to perform a more formal threat model that takes into consideration the design choices being made and the impacts to the application based on those choices. The threat model should be well documented and included in the requirements tracking tool or the code repository tool that the development team is using so that it is available for review and for updates as new alterations are made.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000843"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">However, in the DevSecOps model, some critical decisions are made at impromptu meetings in the team room or in virtual meetings. In this case, threat modeling is less of a formal activity and instead relies on security-minded resources being able to think on their feet about the different issues that may impact the design choice that they are making. This requires security to be tightly integrated with the DevSecOps team. A successful approach to this is to have application security resources embedded in the actual DevSecOps team that can raise questions about the various threats that may impact a given decision. This security-minded team should understand the following:</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-top:18pt; margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-1000858"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">What are the current threats to the application based on the design choices and architecture?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-1000870"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">How do these threats impact the application, and are there known weak points?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-1000885"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">What current countermeasures are in place or need to be implemented to eliminate the threat or reduce the risk?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000897"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Even taking a moment to stop and ask these questions will help the team determine what the basic risk is on the decisions that they may be making during discussions that fall outside the more formal threat modeling process.

I’ve done my fair share of complaining about SAST tools, their speed, and their abundance of false positives. I’ve seen others liken it to the shotgun approach. Not very precise, but effective if you are looking for results. This can become exacerbated if the organization has not taken the time to properly tune the SAST tool. This can be a recipe for disaster. It produces a lot of results that then need to be triaged and processed.

Although SAST tools can be noisy with potential for a lot of false positives, it’s actually an extremely useful tool for detecting issues early in the development pipeline, especially when the application security team and the products they support use SAST in their IDEs and tune the SAST tool per application with specific invariant enforcement, antipattern detection, and specific issue detection, as depicted in figure 4.7.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin:24pt 30pt 18pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><img src="images/Aspose.Words.6efab15f-64c1-492c-8b2f-07973212629d.007.png" width="624" height="229" alt="" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline" /></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:24pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1012004"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#000055">Figure 4.7 SAST in DevSecOps</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000981"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">As you can see, integrating SAST with the intention of getting feedback to the developer as soon as possible provides the ability for the development team to respond and resolve issues quickly. As an example, one of the developers at Superior Products is working on a new feature and is ready to check in their code. Prior to doing so, the developer runs the SAST tool that is integrated into their IDE and scans the code for potential vulnerabilities. During the scan, it is discovered that the developer has a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability that was coded since the code takes input from the user through a form but does not validate that the input does not include script. The integrated SAST tool provides recommendations on how to resolve the issue, and the developer confirms with Dashing Danielle that the recommended remediation will resolve the issue. The developer codes the fix, rebuilds, and rescans with a clean output from the SAST tool.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000996"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Once the developer commits their code to the code branch, additional static analysis scans are performed where the entire application is taken into consideration as opposed to the targeted and incremental scan at the IDE level. The branch scan detects a possible buffer overflow that was introduced when the developer’s code was merged with another developer’s code. The buffer overflow is reviewed by Dashing Danielle and the team, and a remediation plan is devised.

One of the methods I spoke of previously is dynamic application security testing (DAST</span><a name="marker-1009353"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">). This provides a look inward at the application and attempts to discover security issues as it runs in an environment. Likewise, interactive application security testing (</span><a name="marker-1009379"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">IAST</span><a name="marker-1009366"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) can be run inside the application and see attacks as they happen, allowing the tool to observe and report on vulnerabilities. As you can assume, you may not want to run DAST or IAST in a production environment, as shown in figure 4.8, as it has the potential of disrupting normal, legitimate traffic and creating a production outage. However, there are some DevSecOps models that organizations use that allow for at least DAST to be run in both the preproduction and production environments.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin:24pt 30pt 18pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><img src="images/Aspose.Words.6efab15f-64c1-492c-8b2f-07973212629d.008.png" width="624" height="143" alt="" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline" /></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:24pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1012049"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#000055">Figure 4.8 IAST and DAST in DevSecOps</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001096"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Ideally DAST and IAST would be run in the same testing environments that are being used for other testing, like regression and integration testing, as these environments should already be set up and configured for testing. One of the benefits of this setup is that IAST tools need to see activity in order to report on a finding. In other words, to uncover a vulnerability in the code, the application is instrumented with an agent that continuously monitors the application for incoming attacks and reports on the findings. Having a suite of regression tests will help the IAST instrumentation detect potential attacks.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001129"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Fortunately, many IAST tools can be run even earlier in the process. Developers will have running application environments that are local on their machine or will at least have an environment where early testing can be done prior to pushing code to a branch. If the organization has decided to make IAST available to the developers in their local environment, the developer will be able run the chosen IAST tool in that initial environment to uncover issues prior to pushing code to a branch. If the organization has made the commitment to integrate IAST in the developer’s environment, then the developer will be able to run unit tests that will intentionally execute workflows that should trigger alerts in the IAST tool. When something is found, the developer will be able to react quickly to resolve the issue.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001164"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The preproduction environment is where more functionality has been integrated with the application, and the IAST tool will be able to discover broader issues that can only be located once the code has been integrated in an environment that moves beyond the unit tests and begins to run integration and system tests. It will take additional time for the developer to resolve the issue since it would be found later in the process, but it is still preferable to finding an issue in the production environment.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001187"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Complementary to IAST, DAST can be pointed to an environment and run as a security test against that environment. Although it can be used in the development environment, same as IAST, it is more effective as a point-and-shoot tool in preproduction environments where all the code and features are integrated. Ideally, the DAST tool will only test what has changed in an application, perhaps a new feature, UI, or API. This can be accomplished using parameters for a targeted DAST. This type of incremental scan fits well into the DevSecOps model.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001214"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">DAST can be run in a production environment, but in most cases the risk of hindering production traffic is too high. Additionally, if the tools have been properly integrated in the lower environments and the developer’s environment, then the need for production environment testing is less critical, as shown in figure 4.9. I prefer to avoid running testing style tools in the production environments and instead focus on the run-time protection tools in production.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin:24pt 30pt 18pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><img src="images/Aspose.Words.6efab15f-64c1-492c-8b2f-07973212629d.009.png" width="507" height="275" alt="" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline" /></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:24pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1012090"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#000055">Figure 4.9 IAST and DAST in developer’s environment</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001252"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">One additional point of DAST and IAST in the DevSecOps model is that it is necessary to have a feedback loop back into the developer’s collaboration and defect tracking tool.

This is more critical the farther right in the pipeline the issue is found, like the preproduction or even the production environment.

To take their scanning tools and techniques a step further, they integrate both DAST and IAST to ensure they are able to get additional security issues identified and resolved in a timely manner. Dashing Danielle has helped them devise a process to leverage the IAST tool in combination with unit tests, and other testing suites. This has been integrated into the developer’s local environment, which provides them the advantage of seeing only the vulnerabilities that impact the code changes that they made, before the code is checked into a code branch. The tool can identify issues during the running of the tests and point to specific lines of code so that the developer has the ability to make the needed changes.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001668"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Prior to code check-in, one of the developers at Superior Products leverages their IAST tool in combination with their unit test to determine whether any vulnerabilities are present with the new code that has been written. The IAST tool discovers that there are a few SQL injection flaws in the new UI. After consulting with Dashing Danielle, it’s discovered that the developer has not used the scrubbing function that has been built to take user input and detect whether there is a possible injection attack being attempted. Once the developer adds this additional function to reject possible injection attacks, they rebuild the code and rerun the tests. This time the IAST tool determines that no issue has been found and the team is satisfied with continuing to integrate the new code and deploying it to a lower test environment. Here the system and integration tests are run, and additional results can be found from the integrated IAST tool. During this additional testing, it is found that an XSS attack is possible in code from a developer who skipped the IAST scan. A defect is opened, the team is alerted on their collaboration tool, and the developer is visited by Dashing Danielle, who spends time outlining the purpose of the IAST tool and the benefits to the organization, which is not only more secure but also has saved potential costs related to detecting and resolving the vulnerability in production.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001720"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">In this preproduction environment, Superior Products has integrated their DAST tool as well to uncover additional issues. The DAST tool will complement the IAST tool nicely, where findings from IAST rely on indirect testing of the application to provoke a finding, and the DAST tool will crawl the entire application and send attack patterns to weak areas of the site to test whether an attack would be successful. The results from the DAST tool will be less precise than the IAST tool, leading the development team to work with Dashing Danielle to triage and discover duplicates from the IAST tool. In this instance, the DAST tool identified a potential buffer overflow issue when the DAST tool overwhelmed one of the inputs through fuzzing. The development team worked with Dashing Danielle to identify whether this issue was discovered in the IAST or other tools in the DevSecOps pipeline. However, once the duplication review and triaging of the issue is complete, the development team has determined that the finding is true and will be able to resolve it prior to it getting released to a production environment.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001775"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">As I previously mentioned, DAST can be run in a production environment, but this is not recommended, as it can have unforeseen impacts, such as availability issues or corruption of data. There are options to have DAST run less destructive testing, but the organization needs to weigh the cost and benefit. Another alternative reason for running DAST in production would be for testing the security tooling and alerting for the security organization.

These are typically libraries that are from third-party sources or within the frameworks used to build and run the application. An example would be Log4j used by Apache as a logging framework. Frequently, these third-party libraries will be found to have vulnerabilities in their code that require patching. Nothing different than what any organization would do if they found a security issue within their own code that required a patch. In order for an organization to resolve an issue that was found in the third-party library, they will need to package the latest, nonvulnerable version of the library in their own application.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001851"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-callout-head">Note</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> There are cases where the vulnerable library may not have a nonvulnerable version to upgrade to.

It should be no surprise that the earlier in the process this can be completed, the better for the organization, as a change in a library could mean a redesign of the application depending on the library, as shown in figure 4.10.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin:24pt 30pt 18pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><img src="images/Aspose.Words.6efab15f-64c1-492c-8b2f-07973212629d.010.png" width="624" height="121" alt="" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline" /></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:24pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1012134"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#000055">Figure 4.10 SCA in DevSecOps</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001912"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">What this means in the DevSecOps pipeline is that the developer needs access to information regarding the safety of the libraries that they are considering and packaging within their application. This can be accomplished in a few ways. Most vendors today have IDE plug-ins or even browser plug-ins that will let the developer know that the library they are reviewing or about to leverage in their application has a known vulnerability associated with it. Keep in mind that with SCA, the library must have a known weakness, usually in the form of a published CVE that is reported in the NVD. Some SCA vendors will have their own process for detecting weak libraries, but all of them will leverage a public repository like the NVD to locate known CVEs that are associated with the library.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001921"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">With this early access to CVE information, the developer can make the decision to use a nonvulnerable version of the software prior to even writing the first line of code that integrates that library into the application. However, new CVEs are being released daily. This constant flood means that the day after a developer has chosen a secure library to use, it could become vulnerable to a newly discovered issue. Or worse, this can and usually does happen when the library is already packaged and deployed to an environment. This is where the rest of the DevSecOps pipeline needs to pick up the burden. As with the other tools in the DevSecOps pipeline, the earlier in the process, the better. Once the code has been committed to a branch, the integration server that performs the build and test tasks needs to perform the task of calling the integrated SCA tool, usually through an API, to determine if any of the libraries in the software bill of material (</span><a name="marker-1009613"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">SBOM</span><a name="marker-1009600"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) are considered vulnerable. During this build process, any finding can be resolved by breaking the build and requiring a change to the library.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001932"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">This sounds great, but you’re probably already thinking about the implications of finding a vulnerability at this stage in the development pipeline. If you checked in the code and you have a library that has been identified as vulnerable, it will be difficult to package and test a new library in a short period of time. Additionally, there may not be an immediate path to a secure library. In other words, there may be a library with no secure version released yet. This is where a robust risk management process needs to be in place. Knowing what the application risk appetite is and the organization’s overall risk appetite means that the team can prioritize a resolution that matches their risk. For instance, consider a found vulnerability in a library that is used by one of the applications at Superior Products. The library is used to provide a graphing function in the UI to display charts. The particular vulnerability is related to how the graph is rendered. After the build is broken due to this finding by the SCA tool, Dashing Danielle reviews it and recognizes that this particular rendering function is not actually being used in the application, as they are using the library for a different purpose. With this in mind, the risk is identified as being low and the build is allowed to proceed after the application security provides a </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">waiver</span><a name="marker-1009626"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">, meaning that the build can proceed for a set period of time. When the waiver expires, the build will be broken again, but this buys the development team time to provide a </span><a name="marker-1009639"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">secure </span><a name="marker-1009652"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">library </span><a name="marker-1009665"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">once it is available.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-1001956"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">4.3.5 Run-time protection in DevSecOps</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001968"></a><a name="marker-1009704"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Run-time </span><a name="marker-1009678"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">application</span><a name="marker-1009717"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> </span><a name="marker-1009691"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">self-protection (</span><a name="marker-1009743"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">RASP</span><a name="marker-1009730"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) and web application firewalls (WAF</span><a name="marker-1009756"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) play an important part in the protection of the application once it is running in a production environment, as depicted in figure 4.11. Throughout the DevSecOps pipeline, the goal is minimizing the risk to the organization as code is deployed at a rapid pace. When the organization either cannot catch an issue before it is released to production, or an issue is found after the code has been released, the organization then needs to rely on run-time protection to limit the risk.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin:24pt 30pt 18pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><img src="images/Aspose.Words.6efab15f-64c1-492c-8b2f-07973212629d.011.png" width="624" height="138" alt="" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline" /></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:24pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1012172"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#000055">Figure 4.11 Run-time protection in DevSecOps</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002026"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">As mentioned, the best approach in the DevSecOps pipeline is to perform incremental scans using the security tools as early in the process as possible in order to locate and resolve issues as close to when the code is being developed as possible. As the code progresses, the security scanning becomes more aggressive to locate any issues that require more overall application visibility.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002035"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">However, at some point the code needs to make its way to a production environment where it will face the test of real-world attacks. This is where protection mechanisms are required to provide defenses against attacks that were not found earlier in the development life cycle. Not all of these attacks could even be found during the earlier stages of the life cycle. Novel means of attack are constantly being developed by attackers, which means that the scanning of the application is simply not enough. A prime example is the fact that many attackers will leverage multiple vulnerabilities chained together to compromise a system. This means that it’s more than just a single critical, but instead it could be a few lows that turn out to be the culprit in an organization’s compromise.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002047"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">One of the key features of run-time protection tools like a WAF is that many are offered as software as a service (</span><a name="marker-1009782"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">SaaS</span><a name="marker-1009769"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">). This means that the management of the tool is transferred to a third party that hosts the software. The organization can also choose to host their own WAF within their network, but there is an increased cost of managing the internal WAF. This SaaS-based WAF has its benefits and drawbacks. When a new attack method or vulnerability is identified, the third party is generally responsible for delivering a ruleset in the WAF to protect the application going forward. If the WAF is internally maintained, then the security or the operations team will be responsible for delivering the new ruleset from the vendor. One way is no better or worse than the other in the DevSecOps model; it’s just important to know that the management and the timing of when the rulesets are delivered to the WAF need to be considered.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002066"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">With RASP, by its nature, it is integrated with the application and runs alongside of it. This means that there is no SaaS offering, and the DevSecOps team is required to ensure that it is functioning and up-to-date. New rulesets may come in from the vendor of the RASP tool, but similar to the WAF, the team will need to ensure that the rulesets are deployed and do not create a performance or availability issue. Additionally, as new attacks are discovered, it is up to the organization to integrate those signatures into the RASP or WAF. For example, the organization may see a specific type of attack that is not related to the generic rules that are applied by the vendor of either a RASP or a WAF. This specific attack might only impact the organization or the industry they are in, as in the case of a coordinated attack against something like a sports-betting application that shares a common technology stack with other sports-betting applications. In this case, if there is a coordinated attack against sports betting with a specific exploit that is being leveraged only against this industry, then the organizations will want the ability to deploy custom rules that can quickly block these incoming attacks. This assumes that the vendor does not have a generic rule to block the exploit.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002113"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">For both WAF and RASP, one of the key considerations is the testing of any new rulesets that are deployed. As I mentioned previously, most organizations will not use multiple licenses in their protection tools to test multiple lower environments. Especially for run-time protection tools, you are only getting the benefit from them when you are running them in an environment that has the potential to see and block active attacks. These lower environments are not likely to see external attacks unless they are open to the internet to allow customers to test in them, or they are used in penetration testing. One recommendation is to have these run-time tools in a preproduction environment where broad testing is done to ensure that a new ruleset that is enabled in the tools does not create a regression issue. The most common issues are where the new rules block legitimate traffic or otherwise cause the application to no longer function as expected. With these tools deployed and providing protection for the application, the DevSecOps team will have more confidence in delivering new features</span><a name="marker-1009835"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> </span><a name="marker-1009822"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">to </span><a name="marker-1009809"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">production.</span><a name="marker-1009796"></a></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-1002151"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">4.3.6 Security orchestration</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002163"></a><a name="marker-1009861"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Application </span><a name="marker-1009848"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">security</span><a name="marker-1009874"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> orchestration and correlation (ASOC</span><a name="marker-1009887"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) was introduced as a concept in 2019 by Gartner (</span><a href="http://mng.bz/neJd" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentalink" style="text-decoration:underline">http://mng.bz/neJd</span></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">).</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002175"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-callout-head">Definition</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> Gartner</span><span class="css-zv7ju9">&#xa0;</span><span class="css-zv7ju9">defines </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentcalibre21">ASOC tools</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> as those that “streamline software vulnerability testing and remediation by automating workflows.

As described, an ASOC fits well in the DevSecOps methodology, given its ability to automate, deliver quality results, and provide a single pane of glass across the </span><a name="marker-1010043"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">organization.</span><a name="marker-1010069"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> </span><a name="marker-1010056"></a></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-1002393"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">4.3.7 Security education</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002405"></a><a name="marker-1010108"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Security </span><a name="marker-1010082"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">education</span><a name="marker-1010095"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> is near and dear to my heart. It’s the underdog when it comes to security process, tools, and technology. Why is this important for DevSecOps? Simple. Having security-minded developers and operational people when decisions are being made rapidly reduces the burden on the application security team and helps to deliver more secure code from the start.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002423"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">When most people hear “security education,” they think about the video or slide material with a quiz at the end. This is still widely used across probably all organizations at some level. Although there is a time and place for this type of training, it’s not effective for raising the security IQ of the organization in a sustained manner. This only occurs when the organization has invested in a training platform that can deliver training on demand, or even better, at the time when an issue is discovered. Some technology solutions can integrate with defect tracking tools in order to provide a link to application security training modules for the specific vulnerability that was found. For instance, perhaps an SQL injection vulnerability was found in a penetration test. When the application security team opens the vulnerability in the defect tracking tool, the application security training module can detect that the ticket was opened and add a link to the training platform so that the developer has access to information on how to resolve the found SQL injection.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002471"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">One of the key conditions of training is it must be quick and to the point. Most of us get pretty aggravated when we have to sit through not just boring, but also long, training. The most effective training is timely, brief, and often if necessary. As we’ve been talking about DevSecOps, it’s important to point out that many SAST tools have IDE plug-ins that allow for coordination of vulnerability discovery with some quick hit training module. This allows the developer to immediately see why the line of code may lead to a vulnerability. These don’t need to be long either; otherwise, what keeps the developer from simply going to the internet for help? These quick hit modules should be just a few minutes long and in the language of the developer. No corny videos, please.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002520"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">To augment this quick hit training, it’s important to ensure that more traditional training is still available. However, not all security education needs to be death by PowerPoint. Many training platforms today are engaging and approachable by a potentially hostile audience. However, the organization has other options for delivering security training. Some application security training platforms offer the option to host tournaments that will provide a training ground for a large group of developers where they can test their skills in something like a hack-a-thon. Other platforms offer gamified training that intends on providing training where the learner has the ability to test their skills right there and then through training that provides real-world, hands-on scenarios.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002556"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Some large organizations will host internal developer conferences that include a security component. This provides a platform for the security organization to showcase some of the new technology and processes that are working around the organization. This is even more effective when development teams bring their experiences with security and show how it has better enabled them while making them more secure. It’s worth mentioning that the organization doesn’t have to draw on their internal resources exclusively. Bringing in security speakers from the outside is also helpful in showing what some of the organization’s peers are doing. This is a great example of where you can generally get free, or near free, security awareness.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002577"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The biggest payoff with developer training is that it reduces the burden on the rest of the organization and application security team. Anyone who has run an application security function will tell you that there is no way your team can scale to cover all the various applications and areas of concern. The team must rely on the organization to build security in when they are developing code and the tools that are layered into the development life cycle can only do so much.

This means that in a mature DevSecOps pipeline, there will always be code moving through the various parts of the assembly line until it is deployed to production. The security gates are gone from the process. So how do we make sure that developers are getting the feedback like in figure 4.13, the code is secure, and the organization is safe from increased risk?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin:24pt 30pt 18pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><img src="images/Aspose.Words.6efab15f-64c1-492c-8b2f-07973212629d.013.png" width="624" height="278" alt="" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline" /></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:24pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1012248"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#000055">Figure 4.13 DevSecOps feedback loop</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002655"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">To do this, the pipeline needs to have hooks throughout that provide constant feedback to the developer, regardless of where in the process the issue is found. The SAST tool running during code check-in may append the output of that analysis to the code check-in. The integration server will run tasks that execute security scans such as IAST and DAST once the code has been deployed to a workable environment. The output from those tools may trigger a message in the development team’s collaboration tool, as well as automatically open a ticket in the defect tracking tool. It’s also possible that the organization has a policy to block a build on vulnerabilities of a certain type or of a certain criticality level, like a criticality of high or above or if it’s an SQL injection vulnerability, in which case the build would break and the developer would be notified through email or their collaboration tools that the build has been broken due to a change that was made during their check-in.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002709"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">This type of feedback loop allows for the pipeline to continue moving while performing an event-driven approach to the security feedback loop. This means that it is occurring asynchronously and does not create the more state-machine style pipeline where each stage is waiting on the next to complete cleanly before proceeding. This still needs to rely on a “go/no-go” decision before deploying to production. The organization may take the position that they will allow certain vulnerabilities of a particular level into production as long as there is a path to resolution in a short period of time, say, a few days. However, the more mature organization will not allow any discovered vulnerabilities to be delivered to a production environment and will require a clean production build in order for deployment to occur.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1002729"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">As you can see, the DevSecOps pipeline serves the same purpose for two different work streams. On the one hand, being able to deliver value to the customer in a matter of hours is immensely desirable. Likewise, every security person should want that same capability to deliver security resolutions to the organization in a rapid manner.
