against social engineering</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">S</span><span class="c1 c16">ocial engineering</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;takes advantage of what&rsquo;s likely the weakest link in any organization&rsquo;s information security defenses: people. Social engineering is people hacking; it involves maliciously exploiting the trusting nature of human beings to obtain information that can be used for personal &mdash; and often political &mdash; gain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with the challenges society has with expediency (wanting things now, no matter what the cost) and lack of critical thinking (or, just </span><span class="c1 c16">not</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;thinking), social engineering is one of the toughest hacks to perpetrate because it takes bravado and skill to come across as trustworthy to a stranger. By far, it&rsquo;s also the toughest thing to protect against because, again, people are involved, and they&rsquo;re often making their own security decisions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">This chapter explores the consequences of social engineering, techniques for your own security testing efforts, and specific countermeasures to defend against social engineering.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.6cfl3budzc1r"><span class="c19 c8">Introducing Social Engineering</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a social engineering scenario, those with ill intent pose as someone else to gain information that they likely couldn&rsquo;t access otherwise. Then they take the information obtained from their victims and wreak havoc on network resources, steal or delete files, and even commit corporate espionage or some other form of fraud against the organization they attack. Social engineering is different from </span><span class="c1 c16">physical security</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;exploits, such as shoulder surfing and dumpster diving, but the two types of hacking are related and often are used in tandem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Here are some examples of social engineering:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_u4hkb9sbufpx-0 start"><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c24">&ldquo;</span><span class="c7">Support personnel</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; claiming that they need to install a patch or new version of software on a user&rsquo;s computer, talking the user into downloading the software, and obtaining remote control of the system.</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c24">&ldquo;</span><span class="c7">Vendors</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; claiming to need to update the organization&rsquo;s accounting package or phone system, asking for the administrator password, and obtaining full access.</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c24">&ldquo;</span><span class="c7">Employees</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; notifying the security desk that they have lost their access badge to the data center, receiving a set of keys from security, and obtaining unauthorized access to physical and electronic information.</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c24">&ldquo;</span><span class="c27"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hacking-for-dummies/9781119872191/c06.xhtml%23c06-sec-0016&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141778591054&amp;usg=AOvVaw0tfGH-v1-Evr3--KnGjHtz">Phishing emails</a></span><span class="c24">&rdquo; sent to gather the user IDs and passwords of unsuspecting recipients or to plant malware on their computers. These attacks can be generic in nature or more targeted &mdash; something called </span><span class="c11">spearphishing</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;attacks. The criminals use those login credentials or malware to gain access to the network, capture intellectual property, encrypt files for ransom, and so on.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Sometimes, social engineers act like confident, knowledgeable managers or executives. At other times, they play the roles of extremely uninformed or na&iuml;ve employees. They also may pose as outsiders, such as IT consultants or maintenance workers. Social engineers are great at adapting to their audience. It takes a special type of personality to pull this trick off, often resembling that of a sociopath.</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Effective information security &mdash; especially the security required for fighting social engineering &mdash; often begins and ends with your users. Other chapters in this book provide advice on technical controls that can help fight social engineering; however, never forget that basic human communications and interaction have a profound effect on the level of security in your organization at any given time. The </span><span class="c1 c16">candy-security</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;analogy is &ldquo;hard, crunchy outside; soft, chewy inside.&rdquo; The </span><span class="c1 c16">hard, crunchy outside</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is the layer of mechanisms &mdash; such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and endpoint security controls &mdash; that organizations typically rely on to secure their information. The </span><span class="c1 c16">soft, chewy inside</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;is the people and the processes inside the organization. If the bad guys can get past the thick outer layer, they can compromise the (mostly) defenseless inner layer.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.yig6ol7923o9"><span class="c19 c8">Starting Your Social Engineering Tests</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">I approach the testing methodologies in this chapter differently from the way I approach them in subsequent chapters. Social engineering is an art and a science. Social engineering takes great skill to perform as a security professional and is highly dependent on your personality and overall knowledge of the organization.</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;If social engineering isn&rsquo;t natural for you, consider using the information in this chapter for educational purposes to find out how to best defend against it. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to hire a third party to perform this testing if doing so makes the best business sense for now.</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;Social engineering can harm people&rsquo;s jobs and reputations, and confidential information could be leaked, especially when phishing tests are performed. Plan things, and proceed with caution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">You can perform social engineering attacks in millions of ways. From walking through the front door purporting to be someone you&rsquo;re not to launching an all-out email phishing campaign, the world is your oyster. For this reason, and because training specific behaviors in a single chapter is next to impossible, I don&rsquo;t provide how-to instructions for carrying out social engineering attacks. Instead, I describe specific social engineering scenarios that have worked well for me and others. You can tailor the same tricks and techniques to your specific situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">An outsider to the organization might perform certain social engineering techniques such as physical intrusion tests best. If you perform these tests against your own organization, acting as an outsider might be difficult if everyone knows you. This risk of recognition may not be a problem in larger organizations, but if you have a small, close-knit company, people may catch on.</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You can outsource social engineering testing to an outside firm or even have a trusted colleague perform the tests for you.

They&rsquo;d much rather have someone provide login credentials or literally open the door to the organization than physically break in and risk being caught. Security technologies such as firewalls and access controls won&rsquo;t stop a determined social engineer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Many social engineers perform their attacks slowly to avoid suspicion. Social engineers gather bits of information over time and use the information to create a broader picture of the organization they&rsquo;re trying to manipulate. Therein lies one of their greatest assets: time. They&rsquo;ve got nothing but time and will take the proper amount necessary to ensure that their attacks are successful. Alternatively, some social engineering attacks can be performed with a quick phone call or email. The methods used depend on the attacker&rsquo;s style and abilities. Either way, you&rsquo;re at a disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Social engineers know that many organizations don&rsquo;t have good patch management, full network visibility, incident response plans, or security awareness programs, and they take advantage of these weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Social engineers often know a little about a lot of things &mdash; both inside and outside their target organizations &mdash; because this knowledge helps them in their efforts. Thanks to social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and other online resources that I discuss in </span><span class="c3"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hacking-for-dummies/9781119872191/c05.xhtml&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141778596181&amp;usg=AOvVaw313YKGen8ZDIKwxm5nviYU">Chapter 5</a></span><span class="c1 c8">, every tidbit of information that social engineers need is often at their disposal. The more information social engineers gain about organizations, the easier it is for them to pose as employees or other trusted insiders. Social engineers&rsquo; knowledge and determination give them the upper hand over management and employees who don&rsquo;t recognize the value of the information that social engineers seek.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.7wt3sdety5ff"><span class="c19 c8">Understanding the Implications</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Many organizations have enemies who want to cause trouble through social engineering. These people may be current or former employees seeking revenge, competitors wanting a leg up, or hackers trying to prove their worth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Regardless of who causes the trouble, every organization is at risk &mdash; especially given the sprawling Internet presence of the average company. Larger companies spread across several locations are often more vulnerable given their complexity, but smaller companies can also be attacked. Everyone, from receptionists to security guards to executives to IT personnel, is a potential victim of social engineering. Help desk and call center employees are especially vulnerable because they&rsquo;re trained to be helpful and forthcoming with information. In today&rsquo;s world of so many people working from home, social engineering&rsquo;s impacts are even greater.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Social engineering has serious consequences. Because the objective of social engineering is to coerce someone to provide information that leads to ill-gotten gains, anything is possible. Effective social engineers can obtain the following information:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_pw0otg44stw1-0 start"><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">User passwords</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Security badges or keys to the building and even to the computer room</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Intellectual property such as design specifications, source code, and other research-and-development documentation</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Confidential financial reports</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Private and confidential employee information</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Personally identifiable information (PII) such as health records and credit card information</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Customer lists and sales prospects</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">If any of the preceding information is leaked, financial losses, lowered employee morale, decreased customer loyalty, and even legal and regulatory compliance issues could result. The possibilities are endless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Social engineering attacks are difficult to protect against for various reasons. For one thing, they aren&rsquo;t well documented. For another, social engineers are limited only by their imaginations. Also, because so many methods exist, recovery and protection are difficult after the attack. Furthermore, the hard, crunchy outside of firewalls and antimalware software often creates a false sense of security, making the problem even worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">With social engineering, you never know the next method of attack. The best things you can do are remain vigilant, understand the social engineer&rsquo;s motives and methodologies, and protect against the most common attacks through ongoing security awareness in your organization. I discuss how these techniques work in the rest of this chapter.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.ce5t1gfso61e"><span class="c25 c8">Building trust</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Trust &mdash; so hard to gain, yet so easy to lose. Trust is the essence of social engineering. Most people trust others until a situation forces them not to. People want to help one another, especially if trust can be built and the request for help seems reasonable. Most people want to be team players in the workplace and don&rsquo;t realize what can happen if they divulge too much information to a source who shouldn&rsquo;t be trusted. This trust allows social engineers to accomplish their goals. Building deep trust often takes time, but crafty social engineers can gain it within minutes or hours. How do they do it?</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_wg3oedo9gdb4-0 start"><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c7">Likability:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Who can&rsquo;t relate to a nice person? Everyone loves courtesy. The friendlier social engineers are &mdash; without going overboard &mdash; the better their chances are of getting what they want. Social engineers often begin to build a relationship by establishing common interests. They often use the information that they gain in the research phase to determine what the victim likes and to pretend that they like those things, too. They can phone victims or meet them in person and, based on information the social engineers have discovered about the person, start talking about local sports teams or how wonderful it is to be single again. A few low-key and well-articulated comments can be the start of a nice new relationship.</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c7">Believability:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Believability is based in part on the knowledge social engineers have and how likable they are. Social engineers also use impersonation &mdash; perhaps by posing as new employees or fellow employees whom the victim hasn&rsquo;t met. They may even pose as vendors who do business with the organization. Often, they modestly claim authority to influence people. The most common social engineering trick is to do something nice so that the victim feels obligated to be nice in return or to be a team player for the organization.</span></li></ul><h3 class="c5" id="h.9dcnvc8yx4lt"><span class="c25 c8">Exploiting the relationship</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">After social engineers obtain the trust of their unsuspecting victims, they coax the victims into divulging more information than they should. Whammo &mdash; and then the social engineer can go in for the kill. Social engineers do this through face-to-face or electronic communication that victims feel comfortable with, or they use technology to get victims to divulge information.</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.ht6bnsoikfcx"><span class="c20 c8">Deceit through words and actions</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Wily social engineers can get inside information from their victims in many ways. They&rsquo;re often articulate and focus on keeping their conversations moving without giving their victims much time to think about what they&rsquo;re saying. If they&rsquo;re careless or overly anxious during their social engineering attacks, however, the following tip-offs might give them away:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_xq881r5lrzgv-0 start"><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Acting overly friendly or eager</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Dropping the names of prominent people within the organization</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Bragging about their authority within the organization</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Threatening reprimands if their requests aren&rsquo;t honored</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Acting nervous when questioned (pursing the lips and fidgeting &mdash; especially the hands and feet, because controlling the body parts that are farther from the face requires more conscious effort)</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Overemphasizing details</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Experiencing physiological changes, such as dilated pupils or changes in voice pitch</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Appearing rushed</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Refusing to give information</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Volunteering information and answering unasked questions</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Knowing information that an outsider shouldn&rsquo;t have</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Using insider speech or slang despite being a known outsider</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Asking strange questions</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Misspelling words in written communications</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A good social engineer isn&rsquo;t obvious with the preceding actions, but these signs may indicate that malicious behavior is in the works. If the person is a sociopath or psychopath, of course, your experience may vary. (</span><span class="c1 c16">Psychology For Dummies,</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;3rd Edition, by Adam Cash [John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.] is a good resource on such complexities of the human mind.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Social engineers often do a favor for someone and then turn around and ask that person whether they mind helping them. This common social engineering trick works pretty well. Social engineers also use what&rsquo;s called </span><span class="c1 c16">reverse social engineering.</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;They offer to help if a specific problem arises. After some time passes, the problem occurs (often at the social engineer&rsquo;s doing), and then the social engineer helps fix the problem. They may come across as heroes which can further their cause. Social engineers may ask an unsuspecting employee for a favor. Yes &mdash; they outright ask for a favor. Many people fall for this trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Impersonating an employee is easy. Social engineers can wear a similar-looking uniform, make a fake ID badge, or simply dress like real employees. People think, &ldquo;Hey &mdash; that person looks and acts like me, and even hangs out at the same coffee shop, so they must be one of the good guys.&rdquo; Social engineers also pretend to be employees calling from an outside phone line. This trick is an especially popular way of exploiting help desk and call center personnel. Social engineers know that these employees fall into a rut easily because their tasks are repetitive, such as saying, &ldquo;Hello, can I get your customer number, please?&rdquo; over and over.</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.swe69zdzcxw5"><span class="c20 c8">Deceit through technology</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Technology can make things easier &mdash; and more fun &mdash; for the social engineer. Often, a malicious request for information comes from a computer or other electronic entity that the victims think they can identify. But spoofing a computer name, an email address, a fax number, or a network address is easy. Fortunately, you can take a few countermeasures against this type of attack, as described in the next section.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Hackers can deceive through technology by sending an email that asks victims for critical information. Such an email usually provides a link that directs victims to a professional, legitimate-looking website that &ldquo;updates&rdquo; such account information as user IDs, passwords, and Social Security numbers. They also may execute this trick on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Many spam and phishing messages also employ this trick. Most users are inundated with so much spam and other unwanted email that they often let their guard down and open emails and attachments that they shouldn&rsquo;t. These emails usually look professional and believable and often dupe people into disclosing information that they should never give in exchange for a gift. These social engineering tricks can occur when a hacker who has already broken into the network sends messages or creates fake Internet pop-up windows. The same tricks have occurred through instant messaging and smartphone messaging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some well-publicized incidents, hackers emailed their victims a patch purporting to come from Microsoft or another well-known vendor. Users may think that the message looks like a duck and quacks like a duck &mdash; but it&rsquo;s not the right duck! The message is actually from a hacker who wants the user to install the patch, which installs ransomware or creates a backdoor into computers and networks. Criminals use ransomware to extort money and backdoors to hack into the organization&rsquo;s systems or use the victims&rsquo; computers (known as </span><span class="c1 c16">zombies</span><span class="c1 c8">) as launchpads to attack another system. Even viruses and worms can use social engineering. The LoveBug worm, for example, told users they had secret admirers, but when the victims opened the email, it was too late. Their computers were infected. (And, perhaps worse, they didn&rsquo;t have secret admirers.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Many computerized social engineering tactics can be performed anonymously through Internet proxy servers, anonymizers, remailers, and basic SMTP servers that have an open relay. When people fall for requests for confidential personal or corporate information, the sources of these social engineering attacks are often impossible to track.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.rw81o6kwwkuf"><span class="c8 c19">Performing Social Engineering Attacks</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">The process of social engineering is pretty basic. Generally, social engineers discover details about people, organizational processes, and information systems to perform their attacks. With this information, they know what to pursue. Social engineering attacks typically are carried out in four simple steps:</span></p><ol class="c15 lst-kix_gezqg65h9nwj-0 start" start="1"><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Perform research</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Build trust</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Exploit relationships for information through words, actions, or technology</span></li><li class="c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Use the information gathered for malicious purposes</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Depending on the attack being performed, these steps can include numerous substeps and techniques</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.ni3umuuojyo7"><span class="c8 c25">Determining a goal</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Before social engineers perform their attacks, they need a goal. This goal is the first step in these attackers&rsquo; processes for social engineering and is most likely already implanted in their minds. What do they want to accomplish? What are the social engineers trying to hack, and why? Do they want intellectual property or server passwords? Is it access that they desire, or do they simply want to prove that the company&rsquo;s defenses can be penetrated? Perhaps they seek to push their ransomware? In your efforts as a security professional performing social engineering, determine the overall goal before you begin. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be wandering aimlessly, creating unnecessary headaches and risks for yourself and others along the way.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.c4mcywnoioin"><span class="c25 c8">Seeking information</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">When social engineers have a goal in mind, they typically start the attack by gathering public information about their victim(s). Many social engineers acquire information slowly over time so that they don&rsquo;t raise suspicion. However, obvious information gathering is a tip-off. Throughout the rest of this chapter, I mention other warning signs to be aware of.</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;Sometimes, criminal hackers go straight for the kill by sending out thousands of phishing messages at once.

They blast off the messages and see what sticks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Regardless of the initial research method, a criminal may only need an employee list, a few key internal phone numbers, the latest news from a social media website, or a company calendar to penetrate an organization. </span><span class="c3"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hacking-for-dummies/9781119872191/c05.xhtml&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141778607957&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tTqwpajybxYe0I_gENeP3">Chapter 5</a></span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;provides more details on information gathering, but the following techniques are worth calling out.</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.2azdtp8i10j3"><span class="c20 c8">Using the Internet</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today&rsquo;s basic research medium is the Internet. A few minutes of searching on Google or other search engines using simple keywords such as the company name or specific employees&rsquo; names often produces a lot of information. You can find even more information in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings at </span><span class="c18"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sec.gov/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141778608747&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Jfu1lv7YXTzLg-VqIsfzf">www.sec.gov</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and other sites such as </span><span class="c18"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.dnb.com/products/marketing-sales/dnb-hoovers.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141778609138&amp;usg=AOvVaw1e35BdVi6225aqchkKHGzJ">www.dnb.com/products/marketing-sales/dnb-hoovers.htm</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c18"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://finance.yahoo.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141778609446&amp;usg=AOvVaw2rsP2Aa8yxKYU2ag0goym8">https://finance.yahoo.com</a></span><span class="c1 c8">. Many organizations &mdash; and especially their management &mdash; would be dismayed to discover the organizational information that&rsquo;s available online! Given the plethora of such information, especially given what is shared on social media these days, it&rsquo;s often enough to start a social engineering attack.</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;Criminals can pay a few dollars for a comprehensive online background check on people, executives included. These searches turn up practically all public &mdash; and sometimes private &mdash; information about a person in minutes.</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.v9ppb2l0op8g"><span class="c20 c8">Dumpster diving</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Dumpster diving is a little riskier &mdash; and certainly messy &mdash; but it&rsquo;s a highly effective method of obtaining information. This method involves rummaging through trash cans for information about a company.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Dumpster diving can turn up even the most confidential information because some people assume that their information is safe after it goes into the trash. Most people don&rsquo;t think about the potential value of the paper they throw away, and I&rsquo;m not talking about the recycling value! Documents often contain a wealth of information that can tip-off social engineers with information needed to penetrate the organization. The astute social engineer looks for the following hard-copy documents:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_7ga2y74fddme-0 start"><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Internal phone lists</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Organizational charts</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Employee handbooks (which often contain security policies)</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Network diagrams</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Password lists</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Meeting notes</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Spreadsheets and reports</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Customer records</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Printouts of emails that contain confidential information</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Shredding documents is effective only if the paper is cross-shredded into tiny pieces of confetti. Inexpensive shredders that shred documents only in long strips are worthless against a determined social engineer. With a little time and tape, a savvy hacker can piece a document back together if that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re determined to do.</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;Hackers often gather confidential personal and business information from others by listening in on conversations held in restaurants, coffee shops, and airports. People who speak loudly when talking on their cellphones are also great sources of sensitive information for social engineers. (Poetic justice, perhaps?) Airplanes are great places for shoulder surfing and gathering sensitive information. While I&rsquo;m out and about in public places and on airplanes, I hear and see an amazing amount of private information. I can hardly avoid it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bad guys also look in the trash for USB drives, DVDs, and other media. Similarly, they might just plant USB drives around your office or parking lot to lure in unsuspecting users and infect their computers once they plug the devices into their systems.

To access this feature, you usually press 0 or # after calling the company&rsquo;s main number or after you enter someone&rsquo;s voice mailbox. This trick works best after hours to ensure that no one answers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Social engineers can find interesting bits of information at times, such as when their victims are out of town, by listening to voice mail messages. They can even study victims&rsquo; voices by listening to their voice mail messages, podcasts, or webcasts so that they can learn to impersonate those people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Attackers can protect their identities if they can hide where they call from. Here are some ways that they hide their locations:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_enypu0h4gvue-0 start"><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c7">Residential phones</span><span class="c24">&nbsp;sometimes can hide their numbers from caller ID if the user dials *67 before the phone number.<br></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;However, this feature isn&rsquo;t effective when calling toll-free numbers (800, 888, 877, or 866) or 911. Likely, it will work on traditional landlines, disposable cellphones, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, though.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c7">Business phones</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in an office using a phone switch are more difficult to spoof, but all that an attacker usually needs are the user guide and administrator password for the phone-switch software. In many switches, the attacker can enter the source number &mdash; including a falsified number, such as the victim&rsquo;s home phone number.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c7">VoIP servers</span><span class="c24">&nbsp;such as the open-source Asterisk (</span><span class="c14"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.asterisk.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141778614539&amp;usg=AOvVaw1vAZM6n54JIvJDWQuFJ4iL">www.asterisk.org</a></span><span class="c2">) can be configured to send any number.</span></li></ul><h4 class="c5" id="h.j6hbeunewplp"><span class="c20 c8">Phishing emails</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the most common and successful means of hacking is carried out via email </span><span class="c1 c16">phishing,</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;wherein criminals send bogus emails to potential victims in an attempt to get them to divulge sensitive information or click malicious links that lead to malware infections. Phishing has been around for years, but it has gained greater visibility recently, given some high-profile exploits against seemingly impenetrable businesses and government agencies. Phishing&rsquo;s effectiveness is amazing, and the consequences are often ugly. In my own phishing testing, I&rsquo;m seeing success rates (or failure rates, depending on how you look at it) as high as 70 percent. A well-worded email is all it takes to glean login credentials, access sensitive information, or inject simulated malware into targeted computers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can perform your own phishing exercises, and I </span><span class="c1 c16">highly</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;recommend that you do so. A rudimentary yet effective method is to set up an email account on your domain (or, ideally, a domain that looks similar to yours at a glance). Then request information or link to a website that collects information, send emails to employees or other users you want to test, and see what they do. Do they open the email, click the link, divulge information? Or, if you&rsquo;re lucky, do they do none of the above? The test really is as simple as that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Whether the cause is today&rsquo;s rushed world of business, general user gullibility, or downright ignorance, it&rsquo;s astonishing how susceptible the average person is to phishing email exploits. A phishing email that has a great chance of being opened and responded to creates a sense of urgency and provides information that presumably only an insider would know. Many phishing emails are easy to spot, however, because they have the following characteristics:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_xz8sfh23gx4r-0 start"><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Have typographical errors.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Contain generic salutations and email signatures.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Arrive in inboxes at odd times, such as in the middle of the night.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Ask the user to click a link, open an attachment, or provide sensitive information such as login credentials.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">They have a sense of urgency; for instance, they encourage the user to take action by the end of the business day.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A more formal means of executing your phishing tests is to use a tool made specifically for the job.

Social engineering puts your layered defenses to the true test. Even with strong security controls, a na&iuml;ve or untrained user can let a social engineer into the network. Never underestimate the power of social engineers &mdash; and the gullibility of your users in helping them get their way. Heck, even well-trained IT and security professionals can and do fall for social engineering, especially phishing. I see it in my work quite often.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.cdbgplu37h4m"><span class="c25 c8">Policies</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Specific policies and standards can help ward off social engineering in the long term in the following areas:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_u3yt61nz4zly-0 start"><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Classifying information so that users don&rsquo;t have access to certain levels of information they don&rsquo;t need</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Setting up unique user IDs when hiring employees or contractors</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Establishing acceptable computer use that employees agree to in writing</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Removing user IDs for employees, contractors, and consultants who no longer work for the organization</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Setting and resetting strong passphrases</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Requiring multifactor authentication (MFA), especially for critical accounts and systems</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Responding quickly to security incidents, such as suspicious behavior and known malware infections</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Properly handling proprietary and confidential information</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Specifying security standards for personally owned computers that are used to access business systems</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Escorting guests around your building(s)</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These policies must be enforceable </span><span class="c1 c16">and</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;enforced for everyone within the organization.

User awareness begins with initial training for everyone and follows with security awareness initiatives to keep social engineering defenses fresh in everyone&rsquo;s mind. Align training and awareness with specific security policies. You may also want to have a dedicated security training and awareness policy that outlines the specifics of your ongoing security education.</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;Consider outsourcing security training to a seasoned security trainer. Employees often take training more seriously if it comes from an outsider, just as a family member or spouse may ignore what you have to say but takes the same words to heart if an outside expert says it.
