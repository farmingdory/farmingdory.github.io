Whether it is a Fortune 500 technology company or a sole-proprietor landscaping company, software is integral to businesses large and small. Software provides a means to track employees, customers, inventory, and scheduling. Data moves through a myriad of systems, networks, and software, providing insights to businesses looking to stay competitive. Some of that software is built within the organization or purchased and integrated. It enables organizations to move quickly and stay ahead of their competition. In the United States, software in various industries, including finance, sales, human resources, and supply chains, has seen a steady increase, and the trend is continuing. Over the next decade, software in these industries will see a steady increase in market size. For instance, in 2020, the market size of global business software and service was nearly $390 billion and is expected to have an annual growth of 11% from 2021 to 2028. This expansion is based on the increasing need for automation and processing solutions in nearly every sector of the economy.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998627"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The shift to software-driven organizations can be seen in several prominent examples. Movies were rented at a physical store before 2007, when Netflix began streaming them directly to your television. Books were purchased in a shop before Amazon upended not just the book-buying experience but the overall retail market for any item you can think of. It used to take a phone call to order food; now a mobile app allows you to not only order your food but also track it from the restaurant to your front door. Moreover, software is used in all parts of the supply chain by every organization. Leaders in these organizations can get real-time updates on product as it moves around the world and to their customers’ hands. Software is no longer something organizations find nice to have; it is now critical to any organization’s ability to compete.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998653"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-style:italic; color:#3d3b49">In short, software is eating the world.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; text-align:right; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998663"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">—Marc Andreessen</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998673"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Each new piece of software brings new capabilities but also new challenges, especially when that software is available over a network where it is open to a wide audience. More capabilities mean more software. More software means more data. This data is intended to assist an organization and its customers to gain insight into the services the organization offers.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998682"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">However, the additional software and data gives more opportunities to bad actors to exploit weaknesses. Data is a lucrative target for attackers and difficult for organizations to protect, especially when the organization collects a large amount of it. By the beginning of 2020, the amount of data created worldwide had reached 44 zettabytes and is expected to reach 463 exabytes per day by 2025 (</span><a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-much-data-is-created-every-day" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentalink" style="text-decoration:underline">https://techjury.net/blog/how-much-data-is-created-every-day</span></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">).</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998695"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-callout-head">DEFINITION</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> 1 exabyte is 10</span><span class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentsup">18</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> bytes and 1 zettabyte is 1,000 exabytes or a trillion gigabytes.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998714"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The increasing amount of software available and the volume of data, which every second offers a target-rich environment for malicious actors looking for a way in and access to the data. There is constant background noise of malicious activity that pervades the internet. The moment that any software becomes available online, it is immediately probed and prodded. Some of that activity is from automated tools that will then trigger an alert when it finds software that can be compromised. Some of it is from bad actors waiting for the latest gap in security so they can hunt the internet for applications that are vulnerable to it and create exploitation software. Other activity comes from well-financed bad actors who are simply looking for any weaknesses so that they can gain a foothold in an organization in order to come back later for exploitation. If ever there was a more fitting metaphor for software on the internet, it would be the Wild West of the early United States, when lawlessness was rampant, and sheriffs were often overwhelmed and outgunned by the bad guys.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998731"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Software, data, attackers, oh my! When organizations don’t take software security seriously, they run the risk of jeopardizing not only their client’s data, but also the organization’s future. Most organizations that are not in the software-building industry will often say that they are not a prime target, or that their data is not interesting to an attacker. They would be wrong. Almost all data that is collected and processed by an organization can be used and misused by an attacker. Nothing is too unimportant. And although many large organizations can weather a data breach, smaller companies often cannot while remaining in business.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998749"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">It is often said that data is the new oil. Mining, processing, and selling data is a lucrative business both for the organizations that do so openly and the malicious actors who are looking for ways to profit from an organization’s missteps. Building security into the software from the start is the first, and most important, step for organizations to protect their software, their data, and their livelihood.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth2" style="margin-left:49.5pt; text-indent:-49.5pt"><a name="pgfId-998760"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">1.1 The role of an application security program</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998772"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Application </span><a name="marker-1006130"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">security is the implementation of security through practices, tools, technology, people, and processes in the development life cycle. The rest of this book will cover how application security is used throughout the development life cycle to ensure that an organization has reduced the risk posed to its software and has done so in a way that does not impede an organization’s ability to deliver that software in a timely manner. It is important to know that there is never a silver bullet to solving security issues. No one tool, process, or person can guarantee an application's security, as attacks are constantly evolving and technology keeps moving. However, ensuring that you have a robust approach to application security, which includes not just the fundamentals of an application security program but also the ability to adapt and evolve on an ongoing basis, is what sets apart a good program from a bad one. This is what we will discover in this book.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998787"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Products start out as an idea that is developed by a client or an organization's leadership team. Evolving that idea from concept, to paper, to minimum viable product, to a production application that is brought to life takes a team of people from multiple disciplines.

There is something missing so far. Where are the people, tools, and processes that bring security into a product? As mentioned, security is typically a nonfunctional requirement. However, those nonfunctional requirements should not be left up to the product owner and the development team to determine on their own. A mature organization brings in the application security team not just to review the use case and requirements but also, define security requirements that should be in place as part of the feature development. If the product team defines their requirements and begins coding before engaging the application security team, they run the risk of creating security issues that are more difficult to resolve once the feature is nearing completion or ready for release. For instance, a development team may know that they need to provide authorization and may decide to develop an internal solution to manage the authorization without looking at a more fitting solution that is used across the organization and is more industry aligned, like OAuth.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999063"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Fitting security in during the initial phases is done by taking industry and organizations standards and best practices and building them in to the process of creating requirements. For instance, using industry guidance on encryption would lead to setting requirements on key management and encryption strength. Or the organization may have standards that require the development to adhere to certain architecture or regulatory requirements like using a specific analysis tool. Additionally, when building these requirements, the team will take inputs from items like threat models and risk assessments to further develop requirements that align to the business requirements so that security can be built into the process as early as possible. We will discuss threat models and risk assessments more in depth in </span><a name="marker-1006286"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">future </span><a name="marker-1006299"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">chapters.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth2" style="margin-left:49.5pt; text-indent:-49.5pt"><a name="pgfId-999080"></a><a name="id_Toc460350918"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">1.2 The current state of application security</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999092"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">As </span><a name="marker-1006312"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">mentioned, application security is the implementation of security into an organization’s development life cycle. The reality is that application security teams, if they exist in an organization at all, are often external to the engineering teams they work with. They can be found under an enterprise-wide function like the enterprise architecture organization, or under a broader security organization. The last one is the most typical. These application security teams will bring in tools, processes, and people to identify software vulnerabilities that are then backlogged for remediation. These vulnerabilities are found through several opportunities, including the following:</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-top:18pt; margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-999104"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Through the tools that are provided to engineering by the application security team.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-999116"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Through internal or external penetration tests completed by the application security team or an external vendor, respectively.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-999128"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Through identified issues from clients, or other external sources like a bug bounty program, or vulnerability disclosure policy. More on these in later chapters.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999140"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">If the application security team and the organization are considered mature, these vulnerabilities, when found, will block builds. Most organizations that take this approach will set a threshold or vulnerability type that will trigger a block. For example, a vulnerability with a high or critical rating could block a build. You can see how this can cause issues between the engineering team that is working toward a release of code and is suddenly stopped by tools and processes that have been put in place by an external team. Blocking a build is by far the most preferred method for an application security team that wants to ensure a secure product, but this can become an instant point of contention. In less mature organizations, a process is in place to allow the engineering team to continue with their build and deployment by having the found vulnerability backlogged for future resolution.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999155"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The application security team is in regular competition with feature release. Every new release brings new features. New features bring new defects. New defects bring new security vulnerabilities. As mentioned previously, in some cases these vulnerabilities can break a build and block the release of a feature. However, most organizations will prioritize their feature release over a nebulous vulnerability. I will discuss this more later, but many scanning tools are noisy and produce results that are not easily consumed by developers. Furthermore, not all application security teams are great at translating results from tools and other tests into something that is understandable by engineering without having a meeting or work session to understand. This obviously doesn’t scale well in large organizations.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999164"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The security issues are backlogged with an I-owe-you to address the issue in the future. But every new release brings the potential for more vulnerabilities to the growing backlog and the cycle continues. Most organizations will take a systematic approach to reducing vulnerabilities, such as focusing on only the high and critical ones or ones of a certain type, like SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Other organizations may focus on the riskiest vulnerabilities based on product capability and exposure, like a financial organization processing sensitive account information. Some organizations may even have a “security release,” where their focus is on resolving a large number of security issues in a single release. These different methods help reduce vulnerabilities in burst but don’t address the overall issue.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999183"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Like Jacob Marley from Charles Dickens’s </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">A Christmas Carol</span><span class="css-zv7ju9">, these vulnerabilities become chains that weigh down the development team and will eventually haunt an organization. The continued accumulation of vulnerabilities adds to what is called </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">security debt</span><a name="marker-1006325"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">, where an organization continues to add new vulnerabilities to the old ones that were already existing. This security debt increases the risk level of the product being developed and the organization that is selling it. Eventually one, or several, of those vulnerabilities will lead to an exploitation of the application by a bad actor. This is similar to the concept of technical debt that builds when an organization takes a quick and easy path to getting features to their customers instead of choosing more sustainable design choices.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999203"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Further complicating the job of the application security team is the fact that they are often brought in too late in the development process. Usually, it is once the feature or product has gone through several design and architectural decisions. The code development may have already been well underway, or worse, nearly complete by the time the application security team gets involved. This means that many “one-way” decisions may have already been made, and it is up to the application security team to provide some blessing of the design and code or identify mitigations for discovered threats. This is not the case everywhere, but in a sufficiently large organization, this will happen. If the application security team has had the opportunity to provide guidance, requirements, and security tooling early in the process, potential vulnerabilities can be reduced. Unfortunately, the cases where the application security team is involved early are few and far between, despite it being effective. This leaves the application security team hampered with the decision to be “that person” by blocking a release in order to impose security requirements before production or face consequences from the broader organization for allowing code to be released with known weaknesses. Such is the current picture of application security where there exists a constant struggle between enabling the business and reducing the organization’s overall </span><a name="marker-1006338"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">risk.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth2" style="margin-left:49.5pt; text-indent:-49.5pt"><a name="pgfId-999229"></a><a name="id_Toc824059585"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">1.3 Why building security in is challenging</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999242"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-style:italic; color:#3d3b49">There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river.

However, some of these tools detect issues once the code is written, and most likely checked in and on its way to a production environment near you. I will talk more about the various tools in future chapters, but as mentioned, there are several tools that are commonly found in a modern development pipeline related to security. Static application security testing (SAST</span><a name="marker-1006364"></a><a name="marker-1006377"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) can scan written software looking for commonly found security issues like hardcoded passwords and SQL injection.

Software composition analysis (</span><a name="marker-1006459"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">SCA</span><a name="marker-1006472"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) tools will look for known security vulnerabilities and license concerns with third-party and open source software that is used to build the overall application. Additionally, there are cloud architecture, container, infrastructure template, and mobile security tools that can produce scan results that will identify vulnerabilities or other weaknesses in the code or deployment of the software.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999283"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-callout-head">Definition</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">OWASP</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> (Open Web Application Security Project</span><a name="marker-1006485"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) is an open source community of application security professionals who develop standards, tools, and projects to assist organizations with the development of security in their applications.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; vertical-align:top; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1013978"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="vertical-align:top; color:#000055">Exercise 1.1</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1013979"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Take a look at OWASP’s page on source code analysis tools and review some of the available tools.

Some of these tools are great at blocking unwanted activity by malicious actors but at the same time, some tools run the risk of blocking an organization’s clients from using the software as it was intended if the tool is not properly tuned. A common example of this is when a batch job runs and calls an API or function hundreds or thousands of times in a short period of time. This could look like automated malicious activity to the protection tools and could block the legitimate traffic. To separate the two, the application security team and the engineering organization have to work together to pattern behavior into rulesets that block malicious traffic and allow the good traffic. This can come in the form of allowlists for certain URLs and IPs.

However, as with most tools, the effectiveness is determined by how well the tool integrates with the organization and how well it protects or provides legitimate results. Organizations that enable one or many of these tools simply to say they use them, or (*cringe*) say that they block the OWASP Top Ten, are not doing themselves or the organization any favors. Sure, during an audit the organization can say that they are using tool X or Y during their development life cycle. Regardless of whether the auditor’s pencil gets to work checking a box, the organization may or may not actually be more secure.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999471"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The reality is that these tools can create a lot of noise for both the engineering team and the application security team. The scanning tools churn out findings that need to be triaged, rated, and assigned. Many are false positives. The blocking tools create false alarms and raise concerns about the impacts on legitimate activity. And many times, there is an overreliance on the security tools to provide protection, especially when there is a vulnerability that is long in the tooth with no plan to remediate. For instance, an organization may rely heavily on a WAF to provide protection for an SQL injection vulnerability found in an application that has been designated as a “sunset” with a multiyear decommission.

This not only creates additional work on the application security and engineering teams, but also reduces the confidence level in those tools and, by extension, the application security team. When false positives become normal, they become an easy escape route for engineering teams looking to find a way to say that their application is not riddled with vulnerabilities. If the last ten SQL injection issues flagged by a tool were false positive, why would this new one not be? Which brings the application security and engineering teams to a standoff on proving a finding to be a true vulnerability or a false positive. This can be extremely challenging for the application security team, which typically does not have the extensive context that the engineering team has of their own application.

This relies on a detect and respond paradigm that is very reactive and adds to the backlog of vulnerabilities that I talked about earlier where the critical and high ones are usually prioritized while others go to the backlog.

Like most training, security education can quickly be forgotten or pushed aside for the sake of speed of delivery of new features. Developers also change roles, jobs, and functions and are often overburdened with deadlines, tickets, requests, fires, and meetings, which favors moving fast as opposed to secure. This leaves even the most well-meaning, security-conscious developer to push security further down in priority, especially when there is a reliance on the protection tools, as described previously, that will detect and alert on security issues. Security quickly becomes someone else’s problem. Additionally, the tools become a business blocker, which opens the opportunity for the product owner to request exceptions when a feature release is at risk due to a found security issue. Architecture is frequently misused or not well socialized across the organization, meaning that not all development teams are aware of frequently changing architectural patterns that offer more security.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-999731"></a><a name="id_Toc2000663436"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">1.4.1 Shifting right in the development life cycle</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999746"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">When </span><a name="marker-1006654"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">an</span><a name="marker-1006667"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> organization decides that their security posture will be mostly a shift-right one, they integrate tools into the development life cycle that will detect issues and open tickets to the security or development team (figure 1.3).

The effort and disruption that is required to resolve a defect that is already in a production environment can be multiple tens of times more expensive than resolving it at the requirements phase with each progressive phase of development becoming more expensive. There are also service-level agreements that could be at risk when a vulnerability gets resolved in production if an outage is incurred through resolving the vulnerability. This further exposes the organization to additional costs above and beyond the engineering cost of resolution. Security vulnerabilities have the added impact of potentially leading to a reportable event or even reputational damage should the vulnerability lead to a large-scale breach that exposes client data or takes an application offline.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999794"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">However, shifting right does allow the development team to produce features at a rapid pace since security is largely a defensive position when the software is already running in production.

In most cases there are simply too many surfaces and weaknesses in whatever building they find themselves in. As the horde outside grows, the defenses become weaker and the living inside have fewer and fewer options to keep the zombies out. Working in the cybersecurity field can sometimes feel this way. Every time you shore up a weakness in your defenses, a new one is discovered, and your team is tasked with devising a plan to close the weakness and provide a meaningful defense. Additionally, attackers are not always the mindless zombies pressing your defenses; they are often smart, patient, and know exactly what they want.

More features mean more attack surfaces, which means more opportunities for a bad actor to find a way to steal data, impersonate a user, or perform fraud or other nefarious activity. Furthermore, more integration with internal or external applications and services means that there can be exposures that the organization can’t control.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999862"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Case in point: In 2018, a vulnerability in Facebook led to the compromise of tens of millions of Facebook accounts.

No surprise, this feature was called “View As.” Bad actors were able to steal the access tokens of Facebook accounts that allowed them to then log in as the user that the access tokens were associated with. They started with their own connected friends and from there stole the access tokens from their friends’ connections until they had collected several hundred thousand accounts and then several million. They were able to collect personal data, including the usual suspects of name, contact information, places the user checked in, and other private data.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999879"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">This example shows the difficulty in providing a secure product that is open to millions of users with a multitude of features—even for a large organization that takes security seriously. The tools that we spoke of previously may have helped identify this issue prior to allowing the code to go out the door or would have detected and blocked it once it was running in production. However, one of the limitations with these tools is their inability to discover business logic, or workflow-related vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it can be challenging to rely on tools to uncover these issues quicker than end users do.

You have an architectural drawing, a bill of materials, and the actual building materials. You get a group of laborers together, and you get to work building the house. It is far more preferable to put the locks on the windows and doors, build the egress window, and install smoke alarms while you’re building the house. Waiting until the house is built, or after the house has been robbed, or burned down, is too late. Yes, you will save time and money during the building process, but you are less secure for it. This example sounds silly when stated, but the reality is that this routinely happens in software development. Sometimes it is because newer security patterns and architecture are discovered after the software is built, but it is commonly due to the lack of building security in at the beginning.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999966"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">It is far more practical to layer in security throughout the development process, starting with the design decisions being made and requirements being gathered. When this approach is taken, the organization is taking the necessary steps to build better habits and have longer-lasting impacts. Take into consideration your personal health. Studies have shown that adjusting habits rather than going for a quick-fix diet is not only healthier for you but also provides a more sustainable path to better health. Shifting left builds those healthy security habits that will ensure the organization is on the right footing and can sustain a more secure overall posture.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999986"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">A healthy secure development environment starts with making the right architecture and design decisions that take security into consideration. This means picking the right security controls in areas like session management, encryption, authorization, and the like. It also includes leveraging tried-and-true patterns and standards from well-regarded and vetted organizations like OWASP. For instance, the time for picking the right data protection scheme should be determined while architecture decisions around data flow and database technology are being made. Requirements for the encryption strategy should be well documented and provide the appropriate level of protection based on the data classification. Additionally, requirements like field-level encryption with proper encryption key life cycle management are much easier to develop before there is terabytes of data in the database that would require applying encryption to a large dataset. Where this can get complicated is with legacy applications where most organizations cannot provide encryption beyond the disk level due to older technology that may not support more granular, robust, and modern encryption. This is simply due to the fact that the application may never have been designed to work with encrypted data.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000003"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Even the language that is chosen can impact how secure an application will be. There are literally hundreds of development languages that developers can choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses for the given use cases. However, many modern languages provide some guardrails that can keep developers from producing insecure code. For instance, it should be no surprise that Java and C++ tend to rise to the top when it comes to vulnerable code. Much of this can be attributed to the power in each of these languages and the ability for developers to shoot themselves in the foot.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000016"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-callout-head">note</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> One of the most common issues with powerful languages like C++ is its ability to manually manage memory. Most modern languages will take this ability away from the developer as a convenience. One specific example with C++ is the ability to </span><span class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentcode">call free()</span><span class="css-zv7ju9">, which allows the developer to free a memory address. If this is called twice with the same memory address, this becomes a doubly freeing issue.

This person becomes responsible for being at the meetings where security decisions are being made, they perform code reviews on security-related changes, they have to make decisions for the team, and they are generally responsible for correcting or setting a direction on vulnerability management. By the way, this person also has a day job that is usually as a developer or architect for the team. They may not even want the role of the “security person,” but they may have been voluntold. This has a huge impact not just on that individual but also on the team as a whole.

A new vulnerability is discovered in one of the security tools, or in a penetration test. The vulnerability is placed in the defect-tracking tool and assigned to the security person, who then puts aside the regular development work that they were possibly working on to triage the security issue and attempt to resolve it. Meanwhile, several other vulnerabilities have been identified, building the security debt we talked about earlier. This is usually when the product owner, scrum master, or development manager comes in asking why a development deliverable is behind.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000157"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">This type of failure has been seen several times in the past. One of the recent high-profile cases was with the Equifax breach that led to the exposure of over 143 million Americans’ personal and financial information. Equifax is one of the big three credit bureaus in the United States providing consumer credit reporting to Americans. In March of 2017, a vulnerability was found in Apache Struts, a framework for developing web applications. A patch was released, and most organizations set out patching their software. This is generally easier said than done, as some framework upgrades may need additional development changes and testing. In worst cases, an application may need to be re-architected or have major development work completed. By May of 2017, two months after Apache released a patch, attackers had gained access to the Equifax database and began to steal information. Equifax became aware of the breach in July. There were several failures in the security organization that led to the exposure of personally identifiable information (PII</span><a name="marker-1006836"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">). Although the issue was internally identified, the email notifications for the known issue went to an old distribution list and therefore were never picked up by the appropriate team. Additionally, the databases were not segmented from the remaining network, allowing the attackers to pivot to other servers, where they found unencrypted credentials allowing them to escalate the attack.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000178"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">It’s easy for us to sit back and pick apart the lack of patching and other security controls in this case. However, two months from initial disclosure to exploit is a short window for many organizations. Some of these same organizations may have technology running that hasn’t been patched in a much longer time frame. More importantly, the time to exploit these days is much shorter, where attackers are able to gather enough information to reverse-engineer patches and build exploits in days or even hours. But the security person in the development team has the responsibility to jockey with the rest of the features that are slotted for a release and ensure that the application is protected. Given that the Apache Struts vulnerability was only two months old when it was exploited, there were most likely older and more critical vulnerabilities that were already on the team’s plate, ensconcing this Struts vulnerability in the annals of security history. This also highlights the earlier fact that every company is a software company.

The organization needs to have the culture, processes, people, and technology in place to manage this.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000218"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">There is no wrong or right (no pun intended) way of approaching application security.

This is the shift-right approach that has been described previously. The second company, Superior Products, knows that bringing in security earlier is not just easier, but is also more cost-effective than waiting until later. They requested that the application security team be engaged earlier. Even better, they have a security champion, Dashing Danielle, on their team who can provide guidance throughout the development process.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000258"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Superior Products has a mature application security team that keeps their finger on the pulse of the security industry. They’ve integrated a security champions team across the organization and maintain open communication with that team to ensure that they are kept informed of changes in the industry. With this information and structure, they are able to perform threat intelligence that informs decisions on new requirements and technology. In many cases, this allows them to implement security features ahead of client requests to do so. Acme Services is often caught off guard by requests for stricter security and privacy from their clients because they have decided to take the approach of implementing security later in the process.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000269"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Superior Products employs Dashing Danielle to review the use cases that come in from product ownership. She is able to perform a quick threat model on the feature to determine the open security concerns that impact the feature. Based on a risk assessment that she has done previously with the product and the application security team, she knows that the application and the information in the report is considered sensitive information for the organization. This means that she will want to create security requirements that maintain the confidentiality of the information that is contained with the data and ensure that access is limited to a small audience of users within the appropriate organization.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000281"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Dashing Danielle is able to raise these questions about the access to the reports during the review of the user stories and requirements based on the information she has.

Security testing can scale but can be expensive and take time to implement.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-1000518"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">1.6.1 Democratizing application security</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000530"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Application </span><a name="marker-1007018"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">security</span><a name="marker-1007031"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> is less about a dedicated team and more about building the habits, culture, and infrastructure to support secure development. An application security team, regardless of size, relies heavily on others within the development organization to socialize and promote security within the broader organization. It is not possible for an application security team that is relatively small to be able to be integrated with every development team and be a part of every design decision. Without this borrowing of resources from the development organization, application security would rarely be integrated. It is critical for the advancement of application security to be able to find allies, build trust, and democratize security with the overall engineering organization. Throughout this book I will outline the methods used to achieve that advancement; however, to be clear, application security requires a culture of security and requires buy-in at all levels.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000543"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-callout-head">Note</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> It is important to remember that there are teams within the organization that are dedicated to security, whether formally part of the security organization, or security champions who are dispersed across the engineering teams. However, the organization will still require help from those who are not formally part of security. This means that resolving vulnerabilities, ensuring that security is designed into the application, and ensuring that architecture includes security best practices and that the formal security team is brought in at appropriate times rests on the engineering teams.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000570"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The critical part here is the helpers.

The theme is the same regardless of what they are called. We will talk more about a champions program in future chapters; however, the basic principle is that these champions are the connection between the engineering organization and the application security program. They are there to represent the interests of the application security program and to ensure that security standards, designs, and architecture are properly implemented in the areas that they represent. The champion is usually a senior or well-seasoned engineering resource within an application or business unit and comes from within the engineering organization. It is important for the champion to be there because they want to, and not because they have to since a successful champion will be one who appreciates security.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000589"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">These champions help the application security team advance security by being present where the application security team cannot be. Many decisions get made at the stand-ups, in the hallways, or in impromptu conversations between developers. Having eyes and ears that are closer to where the code is developed helps ensure that security is considered in every part of the software development life cycle.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000600"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">One condition of a successful democratization of application security is to ensure that these champions are well versed in the organization’s security culture; know where to find information related to requirements, standards, and architecture; and can ultimately feel comfortable speaking for the application security team. There may even be a formal training and assessment program before a champion can assume the role. To ensure these champions have the information that they need to be successful, the application security team needs to publicize their documentation and guidance and review and gain consensus on new items with the champions on a regular basis. This can be done in a formal, reoccurring forum, or through electronic forums.

It’s not that rare to hear a developer, an end user, a leader, or other technologist say, “We have a security team for that.” We can build all the technical security controls into a system, but once a user contacts a system, an element of unpredictability is introduced. Users want to get their job done or find a way to complete some activity. We have all been in the situation where we were halted by system limitations due to security controls. Most of us do not throw up our hands and walk away. We look for other ways to complete what we set out to do. Users are doing the same thing with the applications you are building—they look for ways to accomplish their work, regardless of whether the application allows it. Additionally, malicious users are probing the application looking for weaknesses. They are not staying within the confines of the application that you developed. In fact, they are looking to do the exact opposite of what your application is designed to do in order to create an error condition that they can take advantage of. Application security is always working to keep up with the curious user and the malicious attacker, and no amount of tools will give us the level of comfort we are looking for. It requires a village dedicated to the security of the application that is devoted to building a secure application from the start.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000650"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">I stated at the beginning that every company is a software company, which means that every company needs some level of software security.

According to the Sonatype “State of the Software Supply Chain Report” in 2020, 1.5 trillion open source software components and containers will be requested by developers. Most software is an amalgamation of third-party libraries, code from software forums, and hand-coded logic by a small group of software engineers and architects. Per Synopsys’s “Open Source Security and Risk Analysis” report in 2020, 70% of an average application is made up of open source software. Reliance on the third-party software leads to exposure to malicious actors getting into the supply chain and adding nefarious code.
