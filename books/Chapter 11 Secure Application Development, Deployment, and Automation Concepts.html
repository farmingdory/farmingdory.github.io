</div>
<p class="noindent-top">Software development is a complex process with many different issues, from design, to coding, to testing and deployment, that need to be considered and managed to achieve the desired goals of secure software. Developing and using a security-inclusive application development process is essential. Expanding that process to include delivery and post-deployment issues is essential, and one of the key tools to achieve these objectives is the use of automation and scripting. This chapter covers these issues with respect to the Security+ Version 6 exam objectives.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Certification Objective</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter covers CompTIA Security+ exam objective 2.3: Summarize secure application development, deployment, and automation concepts.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev112">Environment</h3>
<p class="noindent">Most organizations have multiple, separate computing <em>environments</em> designed to provide isolation between the functions of development, test, staging, and production. The primary purpose of having these separate environments is to prevent security incidents arising from untested code ending up in the production environment. The hardware of these environments is segregated, and access control lists are used to prevent users from accessing more than one environment at a time. Moving code between environments requires a special account that can access both, minimizing issues of cross-contamination.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec232"><span id="page_174" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Development</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>development environment</em> is sized, configured, and set up for developing applications and systems. Unlike production hardware, the development hardware does not have to be scalable, and it probably does not need to be as responsive for given transactions. The development platform does need to use the same OS type and version as used in the production environment, for developing on Windows and deploying to Linux is fraught with difficulties that can be avoided by matching the environments in terms of OS type and version. After code is successfully developed, it is moved to a test system.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec233">Test</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>test environment</em> fairly closely mimics the production environment—same versions of software, down to patch levels, same sets of permissions, same file structures, and so forth. The purpose of the test environment is to test a system fully prior to deploying it into production to ensure that it is bug-free and will not disrupt the production environment. The test environment may not scale like production, but from the viewpoint of the software/hardware footprint, it will look exactly like production. This is important to ensure that system-specific settings are tested in an environment identical to that in which they will be run.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec234">Staging</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>staging environment</em> is an optional environment, but it is commonly used when an organization has multiple production environments. After passing testing, the system moves into staging, from where it can be deployed to the different production systems. The primary purpose of staging is to serve as a sandbox after testing, so the test system can test the next set while the current set is deployed across the enterprise. One method of deployment is a staged deployment, where software is deployed to part of the enterprise and then a pause occurs to watch for unseen problems. If none occur, the deployment continues, stage by stage, until all of the production systems are changed. By moving software in this manner, you never lose the old production system until the end of the move, giving you time to monitor and catch any unforeseen problems. This also prevents the total loss of production to a failed update.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec235">Production</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>production environment</em> is where the systems work with real data, doing the business that the system is intended to perform. This is an environment where, by design, very few changes occur, and those that do must first be approved and tested via the system’s change management process.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand the structure and purpose of the different environments so that when given a scenario and asked to identify which environment is appropriate, you can pick the best answer: development, test, staging, or production.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec236">Quality Assurance (QA)</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Quality assurance (QA)</em> is a common step in any manufacturing process, and software is no exception. Ensuring that quality is in a product is a process issue, not an inspection issue. Yes, testing is still needed, but the current state of the art is to drive security and quality issues via the actual software build process, not to have a series of inspectors after it is built. This being said, there is still a role for people who focus on quality and security issues in maintaining the bug register (a listing of all bugs) and helping the correct people on the team get the correct information with respect to building secure software.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev113">Provisioning and Deprovisioning</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Provisioning</em> is the process of assigning permissions or authorities to objects. Users can be provisioned into groups, and computer processes or threads can be provisioned to higher levels of authority when executing. <em>Deprovisioning</em> is the removal of permissions or authorities. In secure coding, the practice is to provision a thread to an elevated execution permission level (for example, root) only during the time that the administrative permissions are needed. After those steps have passed, the thread can be deprovisioned back to a lower access level. This combination lowers the period of time an application is at an increased level of authority, thus reducing the risk exposure should the program get hijacked or hacked.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev114">Integrity Measurement</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Integrity</em> is defined in the security field as a determination that data has no unauthorized changes. In a software development and deployment environment, this is a very important issue because even little changes can cause huge issues and can be difficult to detect. Maintaining control over a codebase means that two things are happening. First, you have control over the copies in such a way that people are only working on a legitimate codebase. Nothing ruins a day faster than learning your all-day programming session was performed on a set of code that’s not being updated—in other words, you worked on the wrong copy. While not as disastrous as painting the wrong house (you don’t have to paint it back), the work is in essence lost. When code is undergoing constant change from multiple authors, this is not as simple as it seems, and some form of version control <span id="page_176" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>is required. Second, you maintain a log of the changes and a method of identifying the versions. The version control system you use should keep track of the versions, but to clearly identify a set of code requires a different tool. A hash algorithm creates a unique hash value for each unique item it operates on, and codebases are digital objects. Maintaining a directory of hash values that denote the different versions of the codebase is how integrity controls are annotated within the code. If you have a version of the code, you can hash it and look up in the version table to see which version you have. This is superior to labeling in the code with metadata because the labels can be changed, but the hash is tied to the code. When code is released for deployment, it is typically signed digitally, and again the hash values ensure users that the code has not been changed.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev115">Secure Coding Techniques</h3>
<p class="noindent">Software security begins with code that is secure and free of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, all code has weaknesses and vulnerabilities, so instantiating the code in a manner that has effective defenses to prevent the exploitation of vulnerabilities can help maintain a desired level of security. Proper handling of configurations, errors and exceptions, and inputs can assist in the creation of a secure application. Testing the application throughout the system lifecycle can determine the actual security risk profile of a system.</p>
<p class="indent">There are numerous individual elements in the secure development lifecycle (SDL) that can assist a team in developing secure code. Correct SDL processes, such as input validation, proper error and exception handling, and cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery mitigations, can improve the security of code. Process elements such as security testing, fuzzing, and patch management also help to ensure applications meet a desired risk profile.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec237">Normalization</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Normalization</em> is an initial step in the input validation process. Specifically, it is the process of creating the canonical form, or simplest form, of a string before processing. Strings can be encoded using Unicode and other encoding methods. This makes byte-by-byte comparisons meaningless when trying to screen user input of strings. Checking to see whether the string is “rose” can be difficult when “A Rose is a rose is a r%6fse.” The process of normalization converts all of these to “rose,” where they can then be screened as valid input.</p>
<p class="indent">Different libraries exist to assist developers in performing this part of input validation. Developers should always normalize their inputs prior to validation steps to remove Unicode and other encoding issues. Per the Unicode standard, “When implementations keep strings in a normalized form, they can be assured that equivalent strings have a unique binary representation.”</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="stitle"><span id="page_177" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><strong>A Rose is a rose is a r%6fse</strong></p>
<p class="noindent"><em>Canonical form</em> refers to simplest form and, because of the many encoding schemes in use, can be a complex issue. Characters can be encoded in ASCII, Unicode, hex, UTF-8, and even combinations of these. So, if the attacker desires to obfuscate a response, then several things can happen.</p>
<p class="indent">By URL-encoding URL strings, it may be possible to circumvent filter security systems and intrusion detection systems. For example, the URL</p>
<p class="noindent1"><code>http://www.myweb.com/cgi?file=/etc/passwd</code></p>
<p class="noindent">can become the following:</p>
<p class="noindent1"><img src="./public/f0177-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="364" height="40"></p>
<p class="indent">Double-encoding can complicate the matter even further. Thus, the round 1 decoding</p>
<p class="noindent1"><code>scripts/..%255c../winnt</code></p>
<p class="noindent">becomes the following:</p>
<p class="noindent1"><img src="./public/f0177-02.jpg" alt="Images" width="242" height="47"></p>
<p class="indent">And the round 2 decoding</p>
<p class="noindent1"><code>scripts/..%5c../winnt</code></p>
<p class="noindent">becomes the following:</p>
<p class="noindent1"><code>scripts/..\../winnt</code></p>
<p class="indent">The bottom line is simple: know that encoding can be used and plan for it when designing input-verification mechanisms. Expect encoded transmissions to be used to attempt to bypass security mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec238">Stored Procedures</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Stored procedures</em> are methods of interfacing with database engines. Stored procedures are precompiled scripted methods of data access that offer many advantages. First is speed. Because they are precompiled, they can run much more efficiently in the production environment. But because they are scripted in advance, they offer much less flexibility than other methods such as using parameterized queries or building and executing SQL statements on the fly in an application program.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><span id="page_178" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stored procedure is a group of one or more statements stored within a database. Stored procedures are used in programming languages such as SQL, Java, C++, and C.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec239">Obfuscation/Camouflage</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Obfuscation</em> or <em>camouflage</em> is the hiding of obvious meaning from observation. While obscurity is not considered adequate security under most circumstances, adding obfuscation or camouflage to a system to make it harder for an attacker to understand and exploit is a good thing. Numbering your e-mail servers email1, email2, email3,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;tells an attacker what namespace to explore. Removing or hiding these hints makes the work harder and offers another layer of protection.</p>
<p class="indent">This works well for data names and other exposed elements that have to be exposed to the outside. Where this does not work well is in the construction of code. Obfuscated code, or code that is hard or even nearly impossible to read, is a ticking time bomb. The day will come when someone will need to read the code, figure out how it works so it can be modified, or determine why it is not working. If programmers have issues reading and understanding the code, including how it functions and what it is supposed to do, how can they contribute to its maintenance?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec240">Code Reuse and Dead Code</h4>
<p class="noindent">Modern software development includes the extensive reuse of components. From component libraries to common functions across multiple components, there is significant opportunity to reduce development costs through reuse. This can also simplify a system through the reuse of known elements. The downside of massive reuse is associated with a monoculture environment, which is where a failure has a larger footprint because of all the places it is involved with.</p>
<p class="indent">During the design phase, decisions should be made as to the appropriate level of reuse. For some complex functions, such as in cryptography, reuse is the preferred path. In other cases, where the lineage of a component cannot be established, the risk of use may outweigh the benefit. Additionally, the inclusion of previous code, sometimes referred to as <em>legacy code,</em> can reduce development efforts and risk.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of legacy code in current projects does not exempt that code from security reviews. All code should receive the same scrutiny, especially legacy code that may have been developed prior to the adoption of software development lifecycle (SDLC) processes.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><em>Dead code</em> is code that, while it may be executed, obtains results that are never used elsewhere in the program. There are compiler options that can remove dead code, called <em>dead code elimination,</em> but these must be used with care. Assume you have a section of code that you put in specifically to set a secret value to all zeros. The logic is as follows: generate a secret key, use the secret key, set the secret key to <span id="page_179" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>zero. You set the secret key to zero to remove the key from memory and keep it from being stolen. But along comes the dead code removal routine. It sees you set the value of secretkey == 0, but then you never use it again. So, the compiler, in optimizing your code, removes your protection step.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec241">Server-Side vs. Client-Side Execution and Validation</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a modern client/server environment, data can be checked for compliance with input/output requirements either on the server or on the client. There are advantages to verifying data elements on a client before sending them to the server—namely, efficiency. Doing checks on the client saves a round trip, and its delays, before the user is alerted to a problem. This can improve the usability of software interfaces.</p>
<p class="indent">The client is not a suitable place to perform any critical value checks or security checks. The reasons for this are twofold. First, the client can change anything after the check. Second, the data can be altered while in transit or at an intermediary proxy. For all checks that are essential, either for business reasons or for security, the verification steps should be performed on the server side, where the data is free from unauthorized alterations. Input validation checks can be safely performed only on the server side.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All input validation should be performed on the server side of the client–server relationship, where it is free from outside influence and change.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec242">Memory Management</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Memory management</em> encompasses the actions used to control and coordinate computer memory, assigning memory to variables, and reclaiming it when it is no longer being used. Errors in memory management can result in a program that has a memory leak, and it can grow over time, consuming more and more resources. The routine to clean up memory that has been allocated in a program but is no longer needed is called <em>garbage collection</em>. In the C programming language and C++, where there is no automatic garbage collector, the programmer must allocate and free memory explicitly. One of the advantages of newer programming languages such as Java, C#, Python, and Ruby is that they provide automatic memory management with garbage collection. This may not be as efficient as specifically coding in C, but it is significantly less error prone.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec243">Use of Third-Party Libraries and Software Development Kits (SDKs)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Programming today is to a great extent an exercise in using <em>third-party libraries</em> and <em>software development kits (SDKs)</em>. This is because once code has been debugged and proven to work, rewriting it is generally not a valuable use of time. Also, some fairly complex routines, such as encryption, have vetted, proven library sets that remove a lot of risk from programming these functions.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><span id="page_180" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software developers use packaged sets of software programs and tools called SDKs to create apps for specific vender platforms.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec244">Data Exposure</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Data exposure</em> is the loss of control over data from a system during operations. Data must be protected during storage, during communication, and even at times during use. It is up to the programming team to chart the flow of data through a system and ensure it is protected from exposure throughout the process. Data can be lost to unauthorized parties (a failure of confidentiality) and, equally dangerous, can be changed by an unauthorized party (a failure of integrity).</p>

<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of elements under secure coding techniques is long and specific in the CompTIA S+ exam objectives. It is important to understand the differences so you can recognize which one best fits the context of the question.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev116">Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)</h3>
<p class="noindent">The <em>Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)</em> is a nonprofit foundation dedicated to improving web-based application software security. Best known for its top ten list of software vulnerabilities associated with website applications, OWASP also has a multitude of useful guidelines on its website, <a href="http://www.owasp.org/">www.owasp.org</a>. OWASP is a resource that should be actively used by web application programmers to prevent vulnerabilities that are common in web applications. This site has tons of resources to assist developers in producing better and more secure apps.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev117">Software Diversity</h3>
<p class="noindent">Software is not a single product. There are many different forms, and these can be characterized by a wide range of differentiators. Software can be categorized by elements such as platform (PC, server, mobile, IoT device, cloud), programming language, interfaces (web, API, messaging, direct connections), purpose, and a whole host of other factors. One can say that each project in the end is unique. But, the fact that someone can point to why their software is different or special does not diminish the fact that it is a series of instructions for a computer to operate on, and that based on design decisions, coding decisions, and environment decisions, it can and will have vulnerabilities that could enable an attacker to do things that are not desired outcomes. Hence, all software needs security. Having a proper security process as part of the development process is important to reduce vulnerabilities and manage security issues as they are uncovered.</p>
<p class="indent">Another key aspect of software diversity is the issue of monoculture avoidance. As many systems in an enterprise have common elements, such as the operating system, key libraries, and so on, there exists the possibility for common vulnerabilities to affect <span id="page_181" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>many components. A consequence of software systems sharing common vulnerabilities is an increased susceptibility to malware and other attacks with common methods. The primary method of beating this systemic risk is through <em>software diversity,</em> having different components with different software elements.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec245">Compilers</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Compilers</em> take computer programs written in one language and convert them to a set of codes that can run on a specific set of hardware. Modern compilers can take high-level, platform-agnostic code and convert it to machine language code that actually can run on a given platform. In the process of doing this transformation, compilers can manage various aspects of a program, such as memory, code efficiency, and more.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec246">Binaries</h4>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately in the end, all digital computer systems are binary machines. <em>Binary</em> machines operate in one of two states: on (1) or off (0). Grouping these signals (the 1s and 0s) together into words and larger memory and processing structures is what makes computers capable of doing their work. But one interesting aspect of all of this is reproducibility. Two identical computers can run the exact same thing, and the signals and the memory structures will all be identical, because that is how computers work. This leads to another form of important diversity: randomization. Although all computer memory is a collection of 1s and 0s, how these signals are arranged has implications. Having two machines, or more, with completely identical memory layouts again provides attackers a reproducible target. This has led to defenses that include randomizing memory layouts, where the pattern is specific to each boot of the machine and is only known to the machine.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Binary diversity</em> is the creation of identically functioning binary images, but with different specific instantiations. Different locations for memory variables, different pointer offsets, and different layouts in computer memory can all be done today and yet completely preserve functionality. This type of defense makes it difficult for an attacker to bypass controls and inject something directly into memory.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking binary diversity to the extreme, one can run a set of variants simultaneously in a multivariant execution environment (MVEE). The system then unifies inputs/outputs and monitors the operation, enabling detection of when variants diverge in behavior. This indicates abnormal behavior and enables the system to react and recover from a bad result stream.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev118">Automation/Scripting</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Automation</em> through scripting and other programmable means has great utility in software development. The use of these technology-backed methods has led to a field of development known as DevOps. DevOps is a combination of <em>development</em> and <em>operations</em>—in other words, a blending of tasks performed by a company’s application development and systems operations teams. DevOps emphasizes communication and collaboration <span id="page_182" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>between product management, software development, and operations professionals to facilitate continuous development, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous monitoring processes. DevOps can be considered the anti-waterfall model because rather than going from phase to phase, in DevOps, as small changes are ready to advance, they advance. This leads to many small incremental changes but less time between updates and less time to fix or change things. Secure DevOps is the addition of security steps to the DevOps process. Just as you can add security steps to the waterfall model, or any other software development model, you can add them to DevOps as well, resulting in a secure DevOps outcome.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec247">Automated Courses of Action</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the key elements of DevOps is automation. DevOps relies on automation for much of its efficiencies. <em>Security automation</em> can do the same for security that automation has in DevOps. Automating routines and extensive processes allows fewer resources to cover more of the environment in a more effective and efficient manner. Automation removes manual labor costs, especially for skilled cybersecurity personnel. Rather than replacing the personnel with scripts, the use of automation allows the personnel to spend their time doing value-added analysis work.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implications of continuous monitoring/validation/integration/delivery/deployment will likely depend on the details of the question, the context, and the specific question being asked. To determine which aspect is correct requires careful examination of the context of the question. Learn the differences, not just the context of “continuous.”</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec248">Continuous Monitoring</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Continuous monitoring</em> is the term used to describe the technologies and processes employed to enable rapid detection of compliance issues and security risks. More than just a buzzword, continuous monitoring is one of the most important tools available for risk management. Automation and scripts are commonly used as part of a continuous monitoring framework, as they can provide 24/7/365 monitoring of processes and conditions, feeding alerts into the organization’s monitoring system for review and action by security personnel.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec249">Continuous Validation</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Continuous validation</em> is the extension of testing to support the continuous process of software development that occurs in DevOps. As code is changed in the DevOps process, the new code must be tested with the existing codebase to ensure functionality and stability. Making this process part of the continuous development process is essential to keeping development on a timely trajectory.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec250"><span id="page_183" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Continuous Integration</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Continuous integration</em> is the DevOps manner of continually updating and improving the production codebase. By using high levels of automation and safety nets of automated back-out routines, continuous integration allows for testing and updating even minor changes without a lot of overhead. This means that rather than several large updates, with many integrated and many potentially cross-purpose update elements, all squeezed into a single big package, a whole series of smaller single-purpose integrations is run. Thus, when testing, you have isolated the changes to a small manageable number, without the significance of multiple potential interactions. This reduces interaction errors and other types of errors that are time-consuming to chase down.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec251">Continuous Delivery</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Continuous delivery</em> is a natural extension of continuous integration so you can quickly release new changes to production in a sustainable way. Continuous delivery relies on automated testing and is an automated release process that enables the delivery of updates when they are complete, at any point of time, as opposed to a fixed release schedule. When code is ready to be released to production, continuous delivery is the automation of that step, but still under specific operator control.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec252">Continuous Deployment</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Continuous deployment</em> is continuous delivery on autopilot. It goes one step further than continuous delivery in that the release is automatic. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to production. There’s no human intervention, and when all gates are met (that is, there are no failed tests), continuous deployment automatically sends the code to production.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">

<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery—every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is automatically released to customers.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev119">Elasticity</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Elasticity</em> is the characteristic that something is capable of change without breaking. One of the strengths of cloud computing is its elasticity. One can add or subtract resources to or from a cloud environment almost automatically without issue. Elasticity in software works in the same fashion—how resilient the software is to changes in its environment while remaining secure. For software to be elastic, it needs to be able to run under a variety of different conditions. Legacy software that runs in a single thread, although easier to write, is not elastic. When single-threaded software gets employed in an environment of VMs, multiple processors, and cloud environments, its performance is limited to a single thread. Multithreaded software can scale and adapt better, but this also increases the complexity, bringing in issues such as race conditions. For scalability to be stable and sustainable, the software needs to be elastic.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev120"><span id="page_184" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Scalability</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Scalability</em> is the characteristic of a software system to process higher workloads on its current resources (scale up) or on additional resources (scale out) without interruption. Scalability is important in web systems, databases, application engines, and cloud systems. Workloads can vary, and cloud/container systems can add processing and storage, but the software must be capable of addressing the changes in an environment. While this seems obvious, the devil is in the details. Timing loops can affect the ability of software to run on faster hardware, as the system can only run as fast as its slowest link. Scaling out to multiple machines brings in issues of synchronization and coordination. All of these issues can be solved, but this has to happen during design and development, not after delivery.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev121">Version Control</h3>
<p class="noindent">Programs are developed, released, and used, and then changes are needed, either to alter functionality, to fix errors, or to improve performance. This leads to multiple versions of programs. <em>Version control</em> is as simple as tracking which version of a program is being worked on, whether in dev, test, or production. Versioning tends to use the first whole number to indicate major releases and uses numbers after a decimal point to indicate minor changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Having the availability of multiple versions brings into focus the issue of <em>change management</em>. How does a firm manage which versions are currently being used, and how do they coordinate changes as they are released by a manufacturer? In traditional software publishing, a new version required a new install and fairly significant testing because the level of change could be drastic and call into question issues of compatibility, functionality, and even correctness. DevOps turned the tables on this equation by introducing the idea that developers and production work together and create in essence a series of micro-releases so that any real problems are associated with single changes and not bogged down by interactions between multiple module changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether you are in traditional software publishing or operating in the DevOps world, you still need a change management process that ensures all changes in production are authorized, properly tested, and rolled back if they fail, and you must maintain current and accurate documentation.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev122">Chapter Review</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you became acquainted with secure application development, deployment, and automation concepts. The chapter opened with a discussion of the environment, including development, test, staging, production, and quality assurance elements. It then examined provisioning and deprovisioning, and integrity management.</p>
<p class="indent">The chapter then moved on to secure coding techniques. These include normalization, stored procedures, obfuscation/camouflage, and code reuse and dead code. This section included a discussion of server-side versus client-side validation elements and it <span id="page_185" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>closed with memory management, the use of third-party libraries and software development kits, and data exposure.</p>
<p class="indent">The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and software diversity were discussed next. Under software diversity, issues of compiler and binary diversity are covered. The chapter then moved on to the issues from the world of DevOps or automation and scripting as applied to software development. The topics in this section included automated courses of action, continuous monitoring, continuous validation, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.</p>
<p class="indent">The chapter closed with an examination of elasticity and scalability followed by version control.</p>
