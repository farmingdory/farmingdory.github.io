<p><b>1.</b> B. Cloud backup solutions enable enterprises to store their data and computer files on the Internet using a storage service rather than storing data locally on a hard disk or tape backup. This has the added benefit of providing access to data should the primary business location be damaged in some way that prevents accessing or restoring data locally due to damaged infrastructure or equipment. Online backups and removable hard drives are other options but do not by default supply the customer with ubiquitous access. Masking is a technology used to partially conceal sensitive data.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> A. In an IaaS model, the customer must still maintain licenses for operating systems (OSs) and applications used in the cloud environment. In PaaS models, the licensing for OSs is managed by the cloud provider, but the customer is still responsible for application licenses; in SaaS models, the customer does not need to manage a license library.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> A. Information rights management (IRM) (often also referred to as digital rights management, or DRM) is designed to focus on security and encryption as a means of preventing unauthorized copying and limiting distribution of content to only authorized personnel (usually, the purchasers). Masking entails hiding specific fields or data in particular user views in order to limit data exposure in the production environment. Bit splitting is a method of hiding information across multiple geographical boundaries, and degaussing is a method of deleting data permanently from magnetic media.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> B. The only correct answer for this is public, private, hybrid, and community. Joint, Internet, and external are not cloud models.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> B. An encryption key is just that: a key used to encrypt and decrypt information. It is mathematical code that supports either hardware- or software-based encryption, is used to encrypt or decrypt information, and is kept confidential by the parties involved in the communication. PKI is an arrangement for creating and distributing digital certificates. Public-private is the description of the key pairs used in asymmetric encryption (this answer is too specific for the question; option B is preferable). Masking entails hiding specific fields or data in particular user views in order to limit data exposure in the production environment.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> A. The letters in the acronym STRIDE represent <b>s</b>poofing of identity, <b>t</b>ampering with data, <b>r</b>epudiation, <b>i</b>nformation disclosure, <b>d</b>enial of service, and <b>e</b>levation (or <b>e</b>scalation) of privilege. The other options are simply mixed up or incorrect versions of the same.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> C. Nonrepudiation means that a party to a transaction cannot deny they took part in that transaction.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> D. The act of crypto-shredding means destroying the key that was used to encrypt the data, thereby making the data very difficult to recover.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> A. The identity provider maintains the identities and generates tokens for known users. The relying party (RP) is the service provider, which consumes tokens. All other answers are incorrect.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xxxv" id="Page_xxxv"></span><b>10.</b> D. Replacing sensitive data with unique identification symbols is known as tokenization, a way of hiding or concealing sensitive data by representing it with unique identification symbols/addresses. While randomization and obfuscation are also means of concealing information, they are done quite differently.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> A. PaaS uses databases and big data storage types.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> B. Application virtualization abstracts application software from the underlying operating system on which it is executed. SaaS is a cloud service model. A partition is an area of memory, usually on a drive. <i>Distributed</i> is a modifier usually suggesting multiple machines used for a common purpose.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> C. The Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) was enacted in response to corporate scandals in the late 1990s/early 2000s. SOX not only forces executives to oversee all accounting practices, it also holds them accountable for fraudulent/deceptive activity. HIPAA is a US law for medical information. PCI is an industry standard for credit/debit cards. GLBA is a US law for the banking and insurance industries.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> B. A hardware security module (HSM) is a device that can safely store and manage encryption keys. These can be used in servers, workstations, and so on. One common type is called the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and can be found on enterprise workstations and laptops. There is no such term as a <i>trusted operating system module</i>, and public and private keys are used with asymmetric encryption.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> B. This is the very definition of public cloud computing.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> A. In transparent encryption, the encryption key for a database is stored in the boot record of the database itself.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> B. A qualitative assessment is a set of methods or rules for assessing risk based on non-mathematical categories or levels. One that uses mathematical categories or levels is called a quantitative assessment. There is no such thing as a hybrid assessment, and an SOC 2 is an audit report regarding control effectiveness.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> C. The CCM cross-references many industry standards, laws, and guidelines.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> B. Contracts between parties can establish the jurisdiction for resolving disputes; this takes primacy in determining jurisdiction (if not specified in the contract, other means will be used). Tort law refers to civil liability suits. Common law refers to laws regarding marriage, and criminal law refers to violations of state or federal criminal code.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> D. Of the answers given, option D is the most important. It is vital that any data center facility be close to resilient utilities, such as power, water, and connectivity.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> C. Encryption can always be used in a cloud environment, but physical destruction, overwriting, and degaussing may not be available due to access and physical separation factors.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> C. All of the rest of these options represent specific network attacks. Nmap is a relatively harmless scanning utility designed for network mapping. Although it can be used to gather information about a network as part of the process of developing an attack, it is not by itself an attack tool.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi"></span><b>23.</b> B. Among other things, the BIA gathers asset valuation information that is crucial to risk management analysis and further selection of security controls.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> C. This is the definition of the software as a service (SaaS) model. Public and private are cloud deployment models, and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) does not provide applications of any type.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> C. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act targets US financial and insurance institutions and requires them to protect account holders' private information. PCI refers to credit card processing requirements, ISO/IEC is a standards organization, and the Consumer Protection Act, while providing oversight for the protection of consumer private information, is limited in scope.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> C. The purpose of SSL is to encrypt the communication channel between two endpoints. In this example, it is the end user and the server.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> B. Both SOC 1 and SOC 2 are report formats based on the SSAE 18 standard. While SOC 1 reports on controls for financial reporting, SOC 2 (Types 1 and 2) reports on controls associated with security or privacy.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> B. The cloud computing broker purchases hosting services and then resells them.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> C. Cloud computing is built on the model of grid computing, whereby resources can be pooled and shared rather than having local devices do all the compute and storage functions.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> B. Static application security testing (SAST) is used to review source code and binaries to detect problems before the code is loaded into memory and run.</p>
