In this chapter, we’ll continue our review of the internal working of a cloud provider (and the provider’s data center) in a bit more detail.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0002">
<h2><a id="usec0002"></a>Physical/Logical Operations</h2>
<p>The cloud data center has to be robust and resilient to all types of threats, from natural disasters to hacking attacks to simple component failure. This strength and capability has to be comprehensive and exhaustive enough to provide close to continuous system operation and data access (referred to as <i>uptime</i>) for multiple customers with a wide spectrum of service needs.</p>
<p>Currently, the industry standard for uptime in cloud service provision is <i>five nines</i>, which means 99.999% uptime (in some cases, uptime offered by providers exceeds this boundary, to 99.9999%). That’s a vast difference in the level of service expected just as recently as a decade ago. At that time, managed services were often not based in the cloud and instead took the form of contractors leasing and maintaining IT devices and networking capability to customers, often inside the customers’ own facilities. Back then, expected outages for regular maintenance, upgrades, and routine component loss likely incurred scheduled downtime of up to three days each month. Five nines, over a calendar year, on the other hand, equates to less than six downtime minutes <i>per year.</i></p>
<p>In the following sections, we’ll review standards and methods created for the purpose of achieving an uptime of five nines (or more).</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c08-feafxd-0001">
<p class="h4" style="background-color: #E7E7E8;">Uptime and Availability</p>
<p>The CCSP CBK expressly differentiates between uptime and availability. In the most literal of senses, this is true. A data center could be providing continuous uptime, but the cloud customer may encounter availability problems. For instance, the customer’s ability to connect to the data center may be limited by a failure within the customer’s ISP. This would be a lack of availability from the customer’s perspective but not a lack of uptime on the part of the provider. The data center is up, but the customer can’t reach it.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="184" id="Page_184"></span>This may seem like splitting hairs because, realistically, most professionals (or, for that matter, courts or regulators) already would not expect an entity to be responsible for agencies and externalities outside its control. Nobody would consider the cloud provider to be liable for the failure of the customer’s ISP in the first place. Certainly, the cloud provider could not be held liable for not meeting the terms of the SLA in such a circumstance.</p>
<p>That aside, for practical purposes, the terms <i>uptime</i> and <i>availability</i> are usually meant to communicate the same notion: the cloud provider’s ability to offer service within the parameters specified in the SLA, without undue interruption, with the implicit understanding that the provider is not responsible for the customer’s inability to access the data center for reasons outside the provider’s purview.</p>
<p>However, for academic and testing purposes, in the strictest sense, they are not synonymous.</p>
</section>
<section id="c08-sec-0003">
<h3><a id="usec0003"></a>Facilities and Redundancy</h3>
<p>A vast majority of the effort to ensure continuous uptime will be spent providing redundancy of physical components and infrastructure. With sufficient replication of hardware and media, elements can be lost without impact to operations.</p>
<p>When designing a data center, consider redundancy not only for the IT systems and infrastructure, but for all aspects of functionality that support the operation of the data center. These include utilities (electrical power receipt/distribution, water, communications connectivity), staff, emergency capabilities (mostly power generation and fuel for the generator as well as egress paths for personnel), HVAC, and security controls.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c08-feafxd-0002">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems separate the cool air from the heat caused by servers. They provide air management that includes racks with built-in ventilation or alternate cold/hot aisles.</p>
</section>
<section id="c08-sec-0004">
<h4><a id="usec0004"></a>Power Redundancy</h4>
<p>IT systems cannot operate without electricity. The data center will require a power source sufficient to operate all the core processing and storage systems for all customers as well as those support systems necessary to run the data center (such as HVAC and lighting). The cloud provider will want to consider two major aspects of redundancy for primary power needs: energy utility providers and the actual physical connections from the providers to the data center’s campus. Furthermore, this replication of power should carry on throughout the data center itself, down to the component level; each device should have both primary and backup power feeds to ensure availability.</p><section id="c08-sec-0005">
<h5><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="185" id="Page_185"></span><a id="usec0005"></a>Power Provider Redundancy</h5>
<p>Finding multiple power utilities for a single physical plant might prove challenging. Most municipalities are not served by more than one power provider, by legal construct. Power companies are usually granted some form of local monopoly, based on the premise that competing providers would harm the community’s ability to receive power on a cost- effective basis. This is because of the costs of creating and maintaining multiple sets of infrastructure to generate and deliver power. Theoretically, every power provider would have to have its own generation plant, electrical grid, and all that entails, to include lines running to each building for all its customers. This could lead to an overabundance of cables and wires in the service area and decrease the opportunity to create economies of scale by limiting infrastructure to one set. Regardless of whether this theory is true (and it is questionable; telephone service provision was once limited based on the same reasoning, and that market not only survived the breakup of the telephone service monopoly but flourished and expanded, while consumer costs dropped considerably, without an overabundance of telephone infrastructure affecting neighborhoods), most metropolitan areas will not have more than one power provider.</p>
<p>Moreover, the geographic locations often deemed most desirable for data centers are even less likely to have multiple power providers for other reasons. Because data centers are costly to erect, require a large footprint, and need very little in terms of external services (other than power and communications connectivity), remote rural areas are often seen to be optimal for building them: land is cheap, zoning limitations are greatly reduced or nonexistent, and there is less chance of impact from certain types of external threats (civil unrest, fire from neighboring buildings, basic crimes/vandalism, and so on). However, rural areas are also often served by only one power provider, not because of statutory fiat, but because it is not profitable for more than one vendor to offer services in areas with low population density. This could, in turn, make it difficult for cloud providers to find multiple power utilities to serve their data center.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0006">
<h5><a id="usec0006"></a>Power Line Redundancy</h5>
<p>There is a form of attack that almost everyone who has worked in the IT field for any length of time has suffered: having your entire IT enterprise being DoSed by a backhoe. For some reason, backhoes (and bulldozers, and steam shovels) seem to magically be able to locate and slice power and communication lines that lead to buildings, even if the lines are buried sufficiently underground or raised far enough into the air, and even if these locations are clearly marked by utility inspectors before construction activity begins. It’s like a natural law: if you, as a security professional, see construction equipment in the parking lot of your campus, prepare to lose power and communications.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c08-feafxd-0003">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/warn.jpg" alt="Image of Warning" width="69" height="40"> Also, squirrels. Squirrels. I have known of more than one organization that has been DoSed by squirrels dining on the power and communication lines. In one case, it happened to the same organization more than once. This is not a joke, but it is kind of funny. It’s also an example of a natural environmental threat that must be taken into consideration when designing a data center.</p>
</section>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="186" id="Page_186"></span>So it behooves the cloud provider to ensure that all power and communication lines that connect to each of the buildings on the campus are not only replicated, but that the connections are replicated <i>on opposite sides of each building</i>. We want to avoid the backhoe taking out both lines simultaneously, and the likelihood of construction scheduled on both sides of a facility at the same time is somewhat less than on just one side at a time.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0007">
<h5><a id="usec0007"></a>Power Conditioning and Distribution Redundancy</h5>
<p>Another aspect of power provisioning for the data center is the ancillary necessary infrastructure, including power conditioning apparatus and distribution mechanisms.</p>
<p>Raw power from most power mains is not suitable for commercial IT systems. The electricity must be adjusted so as to optimize its suitability for system performance. We call this <i>conditioning</i>. Conditioning usually involves adjusting the voltage on the line. It also includes surge protectors, which attenuate the effects of power spikes that might occur as the result of natural forces (such as storms) or uncontrolled activity elsewhere in the grid.</p>
<p>When designing a data center, it is a good practice to also plan for redundancy in these power conditioners as well as the other aspects of the electrical system. Likewise, other aspects of the power system within the data center that should be similarly replicated include any distribution node, such as transformers or substations, as well as the conduit that actually carries power to each facility.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c08-feafxd-0004">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> When discussing electrical power and resilient design, it’s important to also address backup power systems, such as batteries and generators. We will cover that aspect in <a href="Chapter 9 Operations Management _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html">Chapter 9</a>, “Operations Management,” in the section “Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR).”</p>

<section id="c08-sec-0008">
<h4><a id="usec0008"></a>Communications Redundancy</h4>
<p>Many of the same challenges associated with finding multiple power providers will affect plans for redundant communication providers. In geographically isolated areas, finding even one broadband ISP might be difficult, let alone two or more. However, cloud data centers bring enough demand and need for service that ISPs may build out their current infrastructure specifically to serve those data centers.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0009">
<h4><a id="usec0009"></a>Personnel Redundancy</h4>
<p>When considering redundancy and resiliency design for data centers, remember the personnel who administer and support the IT components and those that operate/maintain environmental support systems. Some of the techniques we can adopt to provide this increased level of robustness among personnel resources are as follows:</p>
<p><b>Cross-Training </b>Whenever possible, have personnel trained not only in their primary duties but in another employee’s duties as well (and vice versa). That way, they can serve as relief or backups for each other for crisis purposes or for ease of scheduling (this is <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="187" id="Page_187"></span>particularly useful in data centers, where constant uptime often means shiftwork, which entails scheduling challenges). This technique, however, is very expensive. Having all personnel trained in multiple disciplines requires not only a significant training budget but also high salaries reflecting investment in top-flight personnel. Only high-quality employees will have the discipline and ability to fulfill a range of functional tasks in areas other than their main duties. If this methodology is utilized to create personnel redundancy, it’s important to ensure that all staffers are engaged in tasks that exercise each of their skillsets on a recurring basis so that they maintain currency in each area and the training does not atrophy.</p>
<p><b>Water </b>Utility redundancy is an important consideration for cloud data centers. Similar to power service, water providers are another utility that may be overlooked in contingency planning. Water supports both personnel and systems for drinking, cooling, and fire suppression. As with electricity, finding multiple water providers in a given area might be difficult. Unlike electricity, however, water is not as difficult or dangerous to generate, transport, and store. In addition to subscribing to the local water district, data center owners can acquire potable water from wells on their own property, or they can contract with hauling companies who can bring water tanks in by rail or truck. Water can be stored on-site for a fairly long time, in cisterns or cooling towers (and a well serves the dual purpose of provision and storage). When designing redundancy for water supply, it is also important to remember to include multiple pumping facilities to ensure sufficient pressure and the power to run those pumps.</p>
<p><b>Egress </b>The paramount concern for all security efforts is health and human safety. The data center buildings—all of them—should have multiple points of escape in case of emergency. This does not have to make your physical defenses porous; emergency exits can be one-way portals (such as doors with interior-facing push-bars, and no means to open them from the outside), and ingress can still be severely limited and tightly controlled. Remember to design deluge fire suppression systems over paths of egress.</p>
<p><b>Lighting </b>In terms of continuous uptime, lights may not seem like an essential element of operations. However, consider a data center without interior lighting or a lighting system without power. Because most data centers don’t have windows (windows are both a safety and a security risk and are largely unnecessary in data centers), a lighting system failure would result in a facility that was both uncomfortable and hazardous for people to occupy, much less get work done. Emergency lights, particularly along egress routes, are important (and often required by building codes), as is ensuring that the lighting is connected to any backup power supply.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0010">
<h4><a id="usec0010"></a>Security Redundancy</h4>
<p>In designing security for the physical plant and site layout, it is essential to bear in mind one of the most fundamental concepts in our field: defense in depth. Defense in depth (or “layered defense”) entails multiple differing security controls protecting the same assets, often with a variety of technological levels and an assortment of the three categories of controls (physical, administrative, and logical/technical).</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="188" id="Page_188"></span>For a cloud data center to meet sufficient due diligence requirements (and attenuate the likelihood of potential threats and risks) pertaining to physical security, all the basic protective measures must be included, and redundancy should come in the form of layering as opposed to repetition. For instance, layered physical defense does not mean having two or three concentric fence lines at the perimeter; it instead might mean including a guard patrol who monitors the fence line, a video surveillance capability, and electronic monitoring of tampering attempts on the fence. This offers redundancy of protection (in the sense of the single control that is “perimeter security”; other physical security measures are also necessary, of course) as well as resiliency. This particularly challenges human attackers, who will need a variety of tools and techniques to breach the defenses as opposed to just one (in the listed example, a wire cutter). Our goal is to make breaching complicated.</p>
<p>In addition to the perimeter, some other physical security aspects that ought to be included in design include the following:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0020" class="none">
<li>
<ul id="c08-list-0021">
<li>Vehicular approach/access, to include driveways that wind and curve and/or include speed bumps as well as bollards, designed to prevent a vehicle from achieving sufficient speed to ram the building</li>
<li>Guest/visitor access through a controlled entry point, involving formal reception (perhaps a sign-in log, video surveillance, and specific staff tasked with that duty)</li>
<li>Proper placement of hazardous or vital resources (such as electrical supply, storage, and distribution components, particularly generators and fuel) such that they are not directly located near personnel or in the path of vehicles</li>
<li>Interior physical access controls, such as badging, keys, combinations, turnstiles, and so on</li>
<li>Specific physical protections for highly sensitive assets, such as safes and inventory tracking mechanisms (perhaps RFIDs)</li>
<li>Fire detection and suppression systems</li>
<li>Sufficient power for all these functions, in the event of a primary power disruption</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 style="background-color: #E7E7E8;"><img src="public/real.png" alt="Image of Real World Scenario" width="234" height="36"><br> Rate the Design</h4>
<p>Let’s review the notional design of a facility in the context of the practices listed in the section “Security Redundancy.” Review this diagram of a cloud data center campus and determine if it has sufficient resiliency, redundancy, and security. Consider what you think are both good and bad points.</p>

<h4><a id="usec0011"></a>Holistic Redundancy: The Uptime Institute Tiers</h4>
<p>Currently, (ISC)<sup>2</sup> looks to the Uptime Institute (UI) for standards related to data center redundancy in pursuit of continuous operations. The Uptime Institute (<a class="codeLabel" href="https://uptimeinstitute.com/">https://uptimeinstitute.com</a>) is an advisory organization for matters related to IT service. UI publishes a standard for data center design, and it also certifies data centers for compliance with this standard.</p>
<p>The UI standard is split into four tiers, in ascending durability of the data center. The standard itself is available for download from the UI’s website, free of charge. We’ll discuss the pertinent specifics in the following sections. (All emphasis in the descriptions of the tiers is added by the author for the purpose of demonstrating the differences between them and not part of the original document.)</p><section id="c08-sec-0012">
<h5><a id="usec0012"></a>Tier 1</h5>
<p>A Tier 1 data center is simplistic, with little or no redundancy, and is labeled Basic Site Infrastructure. Tier 1 lists the minimum requirements for a data center, which must include the following: Dedicated space for IT systems</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0026" class="none">
<li>
<ul id="c08-list-0027">
<li>An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system for line conditioning and backup purposes</li>
<li>Sufficient cooling systems to serve all critical equipment</li>
<li>A power generator for extended electrical outages, with at least 12 hours of fuel to run the generator at sufficient load to power the IT systems</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section class="feature3" id="c08-feafxd-0006">
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="191" id="Page_191"></span><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> Twelve hours is the standard fuel requirement for all four tiers.</p>
</section>
<p>Tier 1 data centers also have these features:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0028" class="none">
<li>
<ul id="c08-list-0029">
<li>Scheduled maintenance will require systems (including critical systems) to be taken offline.</li>
<li>Both planned and unplanned maintenance and response activity may take systems (including critical systems) offline.</li>
<li>Untoward personnel activity (both inadvertent and malicious) will result in downtime.</li>
<li>Annual maintenance is necessary to safely operate the data center and requires full shutdown (including critical systems). Without this maintenance, the data center is likely to suffer increased outages and disruptions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If the data center described in Tier 1 is so sensitive to such a wide array of risks, why is it even considered suitable for operation? Who would want to be a customer of such a service? Well, obviously, the cost of running a facility of this type is going to be much less expensive, and that cost savings is most likely reflected in the price the customer will be asked to pay. Also, this type of facility may be appealing to an organization that is only using the cloud service as a backup for its own enterprise and data (perhaps even the organization’s own private cloud), and it only needs to be available occasionally and very temporarily. From this perspective, a Tier 1 data center might be suitable as a hot/warm site for the organization, with data uploaded on an infrequent basis (perhaps weekly or monthly), or it might even serve as a cold site, where data is only uploaded at those times when the organization is experiencing an emergency situation and needs to enact contingency operations.</p>
<p>So a Tier 1 data center might be the least expensive (if also the least functional) option for an organization that does not require constant uptime and access to resources and data.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0013">
<h5><a id="usec0013"></a>Tier 2</h5>
<p>A Tier 2 data center is slightly more robust than Tier 1, and it is named for its defining characteristics: Redundant Site Infrastructure Capacity Components. It features all the attributes of the Tier 1 design, with these additional elements:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0030" class="none">
<li>
<ul id="c08-list-0031">
<li>Critical operations do not have to be interrupted for scheduled replacement and maintenance of any of the redundant components; however, there may be downtime for any disconnection of power distribution systems and lines.</li>
<li>Contrary to Tier 1, where untoward personnel activity <i>will</i> cause downtime, in Tier 2 it <i>may</i> cause downtime.</li>
<li>Unplanned failures of components or systems might result in downtime.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>With the benefit of rudimentary redundancy, the Tier 2 data center is obviously more suited to cloud operations and is more appealing for that purpose. It may still be more affordable than the higher-tier offerings, but it is now viable as a dependable alternative for <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="192" id="Page_192"></span>continuous use. This may be a good option for small organizations looking to operate in the public cloud environment while still maintaining a relatively low overhead.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0014">
<h5><a id="usec0014"></a>Tier 3</h5>
<p>The Tier 3 design is known as a Concurrently Maintainable Site Infrastructure. As the name indicates, the facility features both the redundant capacity components of a Tier 2 build and the added benefit of multiple distribution paths (where only a sole path is needed to serve critical operations at any given time). Other characteristics that differentiate Tier 3 from the prior levels include the following:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0032" class="none">
<li>
<ul id="c08-list-0033">
<li>There are dual power supplies for all IT systems.</li>
<li>Critical operations can continue even if any single component or power element is out of service for scheduled maintenance or replacement.</li>
<li>Unplanned loss of a <i>component may</i> cause downtime; the loss of a single <i>system</i>, on the other hand, <i>will</i> cause downtime. (The implied distinction is that a component is one node in a multinode system; while each system will have redundant components, not all systems are redundant.)</li>
<li>Planned maintenance (to include scheduled holistic annual maintenance of the facility) will not necessarily result in downtime; however, the risk of downtime may be increased during this activity. This temporary elevated risk does not make the data center lose its Tier 3 rating for the duration.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, a cloud provider offering a Tier 3 data center is a viable candidate for organizations looking to migrate to the public cloud. Most organizations with regular operational needs might consider a Tier 3 option. Those organizations with specialized needs (perhaps organizations with highly sensitive material, such as governmental agencies or entities that utilize a great deal of intellectual property or large-scale organizations with absolute constant uptime requirements) might instead consider a Tier 4 option, but the Tier 3 should serve the purpose for all others.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0015">
<h5><a id="usec0015"></a>Tier 4</h5>
<p>The Fault-Tolerant Site Infrastructure is the premium data center offering. As the Uptime Institute repeats in the description of this tier, <i>each and every</i> element and system of the facility (whether for IT processing, the physical plant, power distribution, or anything else) has integral redundancy such that critical operations can survive both planned and unplanned downtime at the loss of any component or system. Does this mean a Tier 4 data center is indestructible, with permanent uptime? Of course not. Anyone marketing such an offering should be viewed with suspicion. However, it is the most robust, resilient option available.</p>
<p>In addition to all Tier 3 features, the Tier 4 data center will include these characteristics:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0034" class="none">
<li>
<ul id="c08-list-0035">
<li>There is redundancy of both IT and electrical components, where the various multiple components are independent and physically separate from each other.</li>
<li>Even after the loss of any facility infrastructure element, there will be sufficient power and cooling for critical operations.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="193" id="Page_193"></span>The loss of any single system, component, or distribution element <i>will not</i> affect critical operations.</li>
<li>The facility will feature automatic response capabilities for infrastructure control systems such that the critical operations will not be affected by infrastructure failures.</li>
<li>Any single loss, event, or personnel activity will not cause downtime of critical operations.</li>
<li>Scheduled maintenance can be performed without affecting critical operations. However, while one set of assets is in the maintenance state, the data center may be at increased risk of failure due to an event affecting the alternate assets. During this temporary maintenance state, the facility does not lose its Tier 4 rating.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, a Tier 4 data center should be fit to serve any organization considering cloud migration, regardless of the sensitivity of their information assets or uptime needs. It will likewise be the most expensive selection and will probably be therefore limited to those organizations that have the wherewithal to afford it.</p>

<h4 style="background-color: #E7E7E8;"><img src="public/real.png" alt="Image of Real World Scenario" width="234" height="36"><br> Trusting Redundancy</h4>
<p>One particular cloud customer has created a paradigm of utmost trust in the redundancy and resiliency of its network: Netflix.</p>
<p>In 2011, Netflix revealed, via its tech blog (<a class="codeLabel" href="http://techblog.netflix.com/">http://techblog.netflix.com</a>), the Simian Army: a set of testing and monitoring applications the company uses to constantly assess its capability to continue service during contingency situations. The use of these tools demonstrates the willingness and foresight of Netflix to actually create hazards in order to refine and improve its service.</p>
<p>The Simian Army is not just a suite of automated alert and response software, although it does include the Doctor Monkey, which performs both functions after searching all of Netflix’s resources to find any degradation in performance. The Simian Army includes several programs that confounded computer security professionals because of the bravery required to wield them: the Chaos Monkey and the Chaos Gorilla, specifically. These two programs are not responsive: they are aggressive. They purposefully and randomly shut down elements of the Netflix resource network. Netflix largely runs on the Amazon Web Services public cloud. The Chaos Monkey disables specific production instances, and the Chaos Gorilla shuts down entire Amazon availability zones. The intention is to ensure that all the load-balancing capabilities built into the entire network can weather the failure and continue providing service in a manner that is transparent to customers.</p>
<p>That is beyond bold. It’s a move some security professionals might call foolhardy and management at many organizations would deem crazy. Basically, the company is DoSing <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="194" id="Page_194"></span>itself. But it’s also brilliant, gutsy, and ultimately necessary: it is quite likely the only way to be absolutely certain that all the planning and design of redundant systems and the automated response controls that manage them are fully functional in real time.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend this approach for every organization, but those organizations that want total assurance that their cloud resources are wholly fault tolerant might want to consider it. And Netflix has made that capability available to the world: not only did it announce the existence of the Simian Army on a public website, but in 2014, the company made the Chaos Monkey open source and free for download: <a class="codeLabel" href="https://github.com/Netflix/security_monkey">https://github .com/Netflix/security_monkey</a>.</p>
<p>It’s one level of brave to create a methodology as far outside the box as to attack your own resources. It’s another to announce to the world that you’re using this methodology. What if it goes awry? Wouldn’t the failure be compounded by the shame of being caught in your evident hubris?</p>
<p>But it’s a champion level of courageousness to publish the toolset of that methodology and let the world play with it, knowing that there will be a subset of users who might try to…well…<i>monkey</i> with it, in order to eventually attack you. It’s a heroic gamble, that the benefits of a million Chaos Monkeys banging away at systems will be tweaked and refined by the open-source community, and that the goodwill (and improved software) will come back to Netflix like interest on a loan.</p>
<p>This is a very laudable, admirable, and forward-thinking attitude. And I recommend the Netflix Tech Blog for even more, similar content. The blog is written in an approachable, relaxed manner, with a nice blend of technical and managerial information. For readers of this book, especially, the Netflix blog will hold a great deal of interest for its discussion of the company’s decision to move into the public cloud, what its approach was, and the pitfalls it faced.</p>

<h3><a id="usec0016"></a>Virtualization Operations</h3>
<p>From a cloud provider perspective, virtualization is an absolute necessity. It’s the only way to properly manage the cost of hosting multiple customers in a scalable manner and still provide them with near-constant uptime.</p>
<p>Virtualization poses specific risks, many of which have been described in previous chapters. In the next few sections, we’ll discuss what a cloud provider should be considering when planning virtualization operations.</p><section id="c08-sec-0017">
<h4><a id="usec0017"></a>Personnel Isolation</h4>
<p>Because administrators working for the cloud provider will have physical access to devices that may run instances belonging to several customers in the same field (that is, the cloud <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="195" id="Page_195"></span>customers on the same host may be competitors), the cloud provider has to ensure that any impropriety, conflict of interest, or even perception of conflict of interest doesn’t affect the level of service the customers receive. For example, if competing customers are resident on a single host and some contingency forces the administrators to halt one instance or the other in order to maintain the functionality of the device, the administrator should not favor one over the other; preferably, the administrator should make the choice solely on the basis of overall data center performance and operation.</p>
<p>In theory, it is best to mask the nature and details of a customer’s business from the administrators. In practice, that might be less than ideal, and it may be impossible to achieve if such knowledge enhances the administrators’ ability to meet customers’ needs. The Brewer-Nash model, also known as the Chinese Wall model, seeks to ensure that goal. The concept, first posited in a 1989 IEEE paper on the subject, distinguishes access and permissions of administrators based on policy. (You can read the paper at <a class="codeLabel" href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ninghui/readings/AccessControl/brewer_nash_89.pdf.)">www.cs.purdue .edu/homes/ninghui/readings/AccessControl/brewer_nash_89.pdf.)</a> A cloud provider pursuing this end might want to enact such a policy and test it for functionality.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0018">
<h4><a id="usec0018"></a>Hypervisor Hardening</h4>
<p>Because the hypervisor is a prime target for attackers (controlling the hypervisor might allow access to the data in every instance), the hypervisor should receive all the security attention that would have been shown for a bastion host in the DMZ of a legacy network. The hypervisor should be updated and patched to vendor standards, there should be no default accounts on it, and it should be monitored by automatic sensors as well as continual logging and log review analysis. If the cloud provider has to choose between types of hypervisors, the bare-metal (Type 1) hypervisor is preferable to the hypervisor that runs off the OS (Type 2) because it will offer less attack surface.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0019">
<h4><a id="usec0019"></a>Instance Isolation</h4>
<p>Each virtual machine (that is, each instance or guest) should be logically isolated from the others with strict logical controls. (They can’t be physically isolated, by nature of virtualization and automatic load balancing.) Not only should raw data be prevented from leaking from one instance to another, but all metadata as well. No instance should be able to tell if another instance is even present on the same host, much less what that instance is doing or how long it takes to do it.</p>
<p>Whatever controls are put in place to ensure this isolation should be tested and monitored, both in the sandbox testbed and in the live environment, on a continual basis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the possibility of guest escape (a user escalating a privilege such that the user can leave the virtual instance and access the host machine itself) should be attenuated as much as possible.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0020">
<h4><a id="usec0020"></a>Host Isolation</h4>
<p>As with guest escape, the cloud provider should be intrinsically concerned about the possibility of a user on a virtual instance elevating themselves to the point where they can leave the virtual machine, access the host, and reach the network the host is connected to, eventually reaching other host devices or assets on the network.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="196" id="Page_196"></span>All hosts must be both physically and logically isolated from one another as much as possible. They will obviously still be connected to the network and so will, in some fashion, all “touch” each other, so those connections should be minimized and secured as much as possible. Moreover, network monitoring should be thorough and detailed, such that any host escape activity would be immediately recognized and response would result.</p></section>
</section>
<section id="c08-sec-0021">
<h3><a id="usec0021"></a>Storage Operations</h3>
<p>In addition to hosts used to run virtualized instances for customer operations, the cloud data center will also include devices used for near-term and long-term storage of both data and instance images.</p><section id="c08-sec-0022">
<h4><a id="usec0022"></a>Clustered Storage and Coupling</h4>
<p>Most often, storage devices will be clustered in groups, providing increased performance, flexibility, and reliability. Clustered storage architectures can take one of two types: tightly coupled or loosely coupled.</p>
<p>In the tightly coupled architecture, all the storage devices are directly connected to a shared physical backplane, thus connecting all of them directly (the “tightly” aspect). Each component of the cluster is aware of the others and subscribes to the same policies and rule sets. A tightly coupled cluster is usually confined to more restrictive design parameters, often because the devices might need to be from the same vendor in order to function properly. Although this may be a limiting factor, a tightly coupled architecture will also enhance performance as it scales: the performance of each element is added to the overall performance of the cluster, allowing greater and greater power as it increases in size.</p>
<p>A loosely coupled cluster, on the other hand, will allow for greater flexibility. Each node of the cluster is independent of the others, and new nodes can be added for any purpose or use as needed. They are only logically connected and don’t share the same proximate physical framework, so they are only distantly physically connected through communication media (the “loosely” aspect). Performance does not necessarily scale, however, because the nodes don’t build on one another. But this might not be an important facet of the storage architecture since storage commands and performance requirements are fairly simple.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0023">
<h4><a id="usec0023"></a>Volume vs. Object</h4>
<p>Another way of viewing storage options is how the data is stored. Typically, two modes could be used: volume storage and object storage. In volume storage, disk space is apportioned to the customer and is allocated to each of the guest instances the customer uses. The virtualized OS of the guest can then utilize and manipulate the volume as necessary. This is sometimes referred to as <i>block storage</i> or <i>raw disk storage</i>. Volume/block storage in the cloud is analogous to a mounted drive in a traditional network. In volume/block storage, the user/administrator could install and run programs, or simply impose a filesystem for storing objects. Threats to volume storage include the following:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0036" class="none">
<li>
<ul id="c08-list-0037">
<li>Because the volume is simply a drive space, all the traditional data storage threats remain, such as malware, accidental deletion of data, and physical disk failure.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="197" id="Page_197"></span>Moreover, because the data is stored in the cloud, the intermediary threat (a man-in-the-middle attack) exists as data is uploaded and recalled from the cloud and the volume is manipulated by remote users.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In object storage, all data is stored in a filesystem, and customers are given access to the parts of the hierarchy to which they’re assigned. This is sometimes referred to as <i>file storage</i>. In object storage, the user/administrator is limited to uploading, storing, and manipulating files (objects) as opposed to installing and running programs. Threats to object storage include the following:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0038" class="none">
<li>
<ul id="c08-list-0039">
<li>Because object storage does not have a runtime environment, the risk of malware is greatly reduced but may still exist for parasitical viruses, which may infect specific files.</li>
<li>Loss due to physical disk failure remains.</li>
<li>The risk of ransomware attacks may also significantly threaten object storage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0024">
<h4><a id="usec0024"></a>Other Storage</h4>
<p>There are several other forms of cloud data storage you should be familiar with:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0040" class="none">
<li>
<ul id="c08-list-0041">
<li><b>Ephemeral Storage:</b> Temporary resource that is used primarily for processing. Sometimes referred to as <i>instance store</i> volumes, ephemeral storage is provided by devices directly connected to a host machine where the virtualized instance runs—somewhat analogous to RAM for the cloud virtual machine. Threats to ephemeral storage: data in ephemeral storage will be lost if the virtual machine instance is shut down or if the physical drive where the instance store resides fails.</li>
<li><b>Long-Term Storage:</b> Durable data storage capacity, often offered at low cost and large amounts, typically used for archiving/backups. Usually, this type of storage is not suitable for production environments and is not conducive to installing and running programs, but at least some providers offer the capability to run queries and analyze data stored in long-term storage. Threats to long-term storage: insider threat (either users with malicious intent, or administrators at the cloud storage data center); intermediary (man-in-the-middle attack), as the data is uploaded to the cloud; ransomware; vendor lock-in, as the more data a vendor has the more difficult it is to leave that vendor.</li>
<li><b>Content-Delivery Network (CDN):</b> Typically used for large amounts of data that require time-sensitive communication and low latency, such as multimedia content (games, videos, etc.). Instead of hosting an entire library of content at a single, centralized physical location and distributing content globally, content providers may use a CDN to replicate portions of the data at data centers physically located nearer to users/consumers in order to reduce the potential for delay/disruption and decrease in quality of service. For example, a video content producer in Brussels, with worldwide viewership, may opt to lease services from a CDN service host, replicating copies <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="198" id="Page_198"></span>of popular videos in data centers located in Atlanta, London, Moscow, Beijing, and Bangalore; when users in those locations request those videos, the data is served from their local data center instead of having to travel from Brussels. Threats to CDNs: CDNs may be susceptible to intermediaries, insiders (mainly CDN provider administrators), and potentially malware.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0025">
<h4><a id="usec0025"></a>Resiliency</h4>
<p>There are two general ways for creating data protection in a cloud storage cluster: RAID (redundant array of independent disks, although originally termed as redundant array of inexpensive disks) and data dispersion. These two ways of creating data protection are very similar and provide a level of resiliency—that is, a reasonable amount of assurance that although the physical and/or logical environment might be partially affected by detrimental occurrences (outages, attacks, and so on), the overall bulk of data will not be lost permanently.</p>
<p>In most RAID configurations, all data is stored across the various disks in a method known as <i>striping</i>. This allows data to be recovered in a more efficient manner because if one of the drives fails, the missing data can be filled in by the other drives. In some RAID schemes (there are many, known as RAID 0–10, with different levels of performance, redundancy, and integrity, depending on the owner’s needs), parity bits are added to the raw data to aid in recovery after a drive failure.</p>
<p>Data dispersion is a similar technique, where data is sliced into “chunks” (sometimes referred to as “shards”) that are encrypted along with parity bits (called <i>erasure coding</i> in cloud data dispersion) and then written to various drives in the cloud cluster. The parity bits/erasure coding allow for the recovery of partial data lost (stored on one “drive” or device or storage area) by re-creating the lost data from the remaining data plus the parity bits/erasure code. Data dispersion can be seen as equivalent to creating a RAID array in a cloud environment. This technique is also often referred to as <i>bit splitting</i>.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c08-feafxd-0008">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> Secret sharing made short (SSMS) is a method of bit splitting that uses the three phases: encryption, using an information dispersal algorithm, and splitting the encryption key using the secret sharing algorithm. The fragments are signed and distributed to different cloud storage services, making it difficult to decrypt without both arbitrarily chosen data and encryption key fragments.</p>
</section>
<p>Data dispersion provides multiple benefits. Depending on the encryption configuration, partial loss of data (say, one component in the storage cluster failing) will not result in total unavailability of the data set; the lost portion can be recovered from the remaining components in the cluster, using the parity bits/erasure coding. Another benefit is greater security from both physical and logical theft: if one device containing dispersed data is taken from the cloud data center, or accessed through unauthorized means, the chunks/shards on that device will not be meaningful or useful to the thief as it will be unreadable out of context <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="199" id="Page_199"></span>with the other chunks/shards and will also be encrypted. This also protects the data of a cloud customer if a device is seized/accessed by regulators/law enforcement for an investigation into another customer—the information of Customer A, if dispersed, is not revealed when the regulator accesses the device looking for Customer B’s data.</p></section>

<section id="c08-sec-0026">
<h3><a id="usec0026"></a>Physical and Logical Isolation</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we’ve already discussed the need for both physical and logical isolation of personnel, the various virtualized instances, and storage devices in a cluster. The same principles should be applied throughout the cloud data center to include other isolation techniques and technologies. These include restricted physical access to devices, secure interface devices, and restricted logical access to devices.</p><section id="c08-sec-0027">
<h4><a id="usec0027"></a>Restricted Physical Access to Devices</h4>
<p>Access to racks in the data center should be limited to those administrators and maintainers who absolutely need to reach the devices in order to perform their job functions. Entry and egress should be controlled, monitored, and logged. Racks should be locked, and keys for each respective rack should have to be checked out only for the duration of use. Likewise, KVMs should have to be checked out by the administrator needing to use them for a specific task and checked in at their return.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0028">
<h4><a id="usec0028"></a>Secure KVMs</h4>
<p>The human interface devices such as keyboards, video displays, and mice (KVMs) used to access production devices—both processing and storage—should be hardened for security purposes. Secure KVMs differ from their mundane counterparts in that they are designed to deter and detect tampering. They are also, as might be expected, usually quite a bit more expensive.</p>
<p>Secure KVMs should have the following traits:</p>
<p><b>Secure Data Ports </b>These reduce the likelihood of data leaking between computers that are connected through the KVM.</p>
<p><b>Tamper Labels </b>These provide a clear indication if the unit housing has been breached. They might also be supported by warning lights that alert you when the exterior case is opened.</p>
<p><b>Fixed Firmware </b>This cannot be flashed or reprogrammed.</p>
<p><b>Soldered Circuit Board </b>Soldering is used instead of adhesive so that the board itself or its chipsets or other components cannot be removed and replaced.</p>
<p><b>Reduced Buffer </b>Data is not stored beyond the immediate needs of the device.</p>

<h4><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="200" id="Page_200"></span><a id="usec0029"></a>Restricted Logical Access to Devices</h4>
<p>Where possible, devices should be located on secure subnets, limiting the ability of malicious intruders. (This may be difficult in a cloud environment, where resources are apportioned automatically, often across the entirety of the data center.) Use of USB ports should be severely controlled and eliminated wherever possible. Restrict the potential for any portable media to be carried into or out of the data center undetected.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c08-feafxd-0009">
<h4 style="background-color: #E7E7E8;">Cloud Usage</h4>
<p>Many new and emerging technologies, such as blockchain, neural networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT), are highly dependent on distributed processing/networking, intense processing, and high-speed connectivity. This makes them ideal for cloud environments.</p>
<p>Other technologies, such as containers, facilitate and further popularize the use of cloud services. Containers are a means, other than or in addition to virtual machines, for running applications in a distributed, heterogeneous IT environment. The container is a package of software necessities (code, bins, libraries, and so on) that can run on any standard OS or platform. An organization using a container can ensure that the organization’s applications will perform in a standard way across a nonstandard environment.</p>

<h3><a id="usec0030"></a>Application Testing Methods</h3>
<p>In this section, I’ll briefly describe some of the methods used for application testing from a rather high-level perspective. Again, readers familiar with the SDLC and its secure implementation should already have some knowledge of this material.</p>
<p>Static application security testing (SAST) is a direct review of the actual source code an application comprises. It is often to referred to as <i>white-box testing</i>. Benefits include direct and early assessment of potential flaws, long before the application is even considered for the production environment. Unfortunately, effective SAST requires a great deal of specific knowledge of the particular code as well as expert comprehension of potential negative outcomes. This kind of skillset is usually found in personnel already involved in programming; it’s rare that an organization would have this sort of person available for the limited task of software testing. So SAST might often be performed by contract personnel on a finite basis. This introduces an additional potential detriment to the development process: the number of iterations for which they can be tasked might be extremely limited, and certainly expensive. However, application owners want to be sure that applications are <i>not</i> being tested by the developers who wrote them. There is too much chance that the developers will miss errors they’ve made (or else they would not have made them) or that they will be understandably inherently biased toward their own creation. This would pose a conflict of interest and violate the principle of separation of duties. There are also automated tools that can perform code review; however, much like definition-based malware solutions, automated code <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="201" id="Page_201"></span>review tools will only detect known and recognized flaws and vulnerabilities and are not exhaustive.</p>
<p>Dynamic application security testing (DAST), on the other hand, does not pertain to source code. Instead, it reviews outcomes of the application as it is executed in runtime. It is often referred to as black-box testing. DAST often involves a group of users in a test environment, running the application and trying to see whether it performs correctly or will fail under multiple inputs and conditions. This can also be construed as a form of functional testing because the various test inputs can include known good data to determine if known good results are produced. DAST is not nearly as granular as SAST, and something that might have been revealed by expert SAST might be missed in DAST.</p>
<p>Of course, it is possible—and desirable—to perform both kinds of testing on a particular application.</p>
<p>The STRIDE threat model, explained in <a href="Chapter 7 Cloud Application Security _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html">Chapter 7</a>, is also extremely useful for guiding application testing efforts. Developers and the Quality Assurance/testing team should use the STRIDE approach to help craft test parameters and methods.</p></section>

<h2><a id="usec0031"></a>Security Operations Center</h2>
<p>Most data centers will have a centralized facility for continuous monitoring of network performance and security controls. This is commonly known as the security operations center (or sometimes network operations center or similar terms). Typically, physical access will be limited to security personnel and administrators overseeing live and historic feeds from security devices and agents placed throughout the IT environment. Tools such as DLP, anti-malware, SIEM/SEM/SIM, firewalls, and IDS/IPS will present logs and reports to the security operations center for analysis and real-time response.</p>
<p>For modern IT environments, the security operations center does not have to be physically located inside the data center itself or even on the same campus. A security operations center for an enterprise with many different branches and offices may be located remotely, monitoring at a distance. In fact, in many cases, the security operations and continuous monitoring function might be performed by a contracted third party, a vendor with the tools, knowledge, and personnel for providing security as a core competency.</p>
<p>In a cloud-managed services arrangement, the provider will most likely have a security operations center overseeing the various cloud data centers and underlying infrastructure and, depending on the service and deployment models, the platforms and applications as well. The cloud customer, however, may also have a security operation monitoring its own users/cloud accounts and interactions. There may be some shared responsibility and activity between the provider and customer for detection, reporting, investigation, and response actions. All of these need to be established in the contract.</p><section id="c08-sec-0032">
<h3><a id="usec0032"></a>Continuous Monitoring</h3>
<p>The security controls in the IT environment are not durable. A control cannot be purchased, implemented, and then considered complete (and the associated risk the control was <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="202" id="Page_202"></span>intended to address cannot be considered permanently mitigated). Instead, controls must be continually monitored to ensure that they are effective, operating as intended, and addressing the risks or vulnerabilities that they were supposed to mitigate. Moreover, the entire environment must be monitored continually to determine if new or emerging threats or risks are dealt with properly.</p>
<p>Older security paradigms required periodic risk reviews and might deem an IT environment as protected for a certain duration if the review was successful or had no significant findings. Current guidance and industry best standards refute that model, instead stating the preferred approach of continuous monitoring. NIST (in the Risk Management Framework), ISO (in the 27000 series of IT security standards), and the CIS (formerly SANS Top 20 security controls guidance) all make continuous monitoring a central tenet of protecting an IT environment.</p></section>
<section id="c08-sec-0033">
<h3><a id="usec0033"></a>Incident Management</h3>
<p>When the security operations center detects or receives a report of anomalous or illicit activity, an incident response action might be initiated. Incident response might include the following purposes:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0042" class="none">
<li>
<ul id="c08-list-0043">
<li>Minimizing the loss of value/assets</li>
<li>Continuing service provision (availability)</li>
<li>Halting increase of the damage</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The intended outcome will significantly impact the course of action taken in the response, and it will be different for every industry or organization. For example, a large online retailer that conducts thousands of commercial transactions per hour might be most concerned will availability—continuing the transactions. If the retailer discovers that a piece of malware is skimming money from the retailer so that the retailer is losing hundreds of dollars per hour but the retailer’s revenues are hundreds of thousands of dollars per hour, the retailer probably won’t want to shut down operations in order to address the malware issue. The retailer may continue allowing the loss to continue for an extended period of time because the impact of shutting down the environment would be much more damaging than the effect of the malware. Another potential outcome might be a form of legal recourse—either a lawsuit or prosecution.</p>
<p>The organization should have an incident response policy and plan. Both the cloud provider and customer will have their own approaches, goals, and methods for incident management. The two parties should coordinate and share these responsibilities and codify this arrangement in the contract.</p>
<p>Moreover, incident response in a managed services arrangement creates additional challenges and risks. For instance, which party can declare an incident unilaterally? Do both parties have to concur that an incident has occurred? If the provider declares an incident, is the provider relieved of the requirement to meet certain SLA performance targets (say, availability) for the duration of the incident? If there are additional costs associated with incident response, such as downtime, personnel tasking, or reporting actions, which party is responsible for absorbing these costs?</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="203" id="Page_203"></span>The customer will have to consider all these questions (and others) pertinent to incident management when planning cloud migration and selecting a provider.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c08-feafxd-0010">
<h4 style="background-color: #E7E7E8;">Knowing Your Cloud</h4>
<p>How does a customer verify whether a certain service provider will meet the customer’s needs, particular if the customer is in a highly regulated industry or deals with sensitive/regulated information?</p>
<p>There are a great many regulatory schemes globally, for a wide variety of industries and legal frameworks. Many of these legal or contractual constructs offer certification (either by the standard bodies or through the use of approved auditors deemed worthy by them). The customer required to adhere to a given mandate can select from those providers who have obtained the necessary certifications.</p>
<p>For instance, an organization that takes payments via credit card must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). If that organization is considering cloud migration, the organization needs to find a provider that has likewise obtained PCI DSS certification. If the provider claims to be “PCI DSS compliant,” that fact should be included in the contract between customer and provider, and the provider should offer some contractual, binding assurance that the customer will not be found noncompliant because of any deficiency or shortcoming in the managed cloud environment.</p>
<p>Even a customer that is not required to comply with PCI DSS might view a provider that has a PCI DSS certification as more trustworthy and viable than one that does not. The customer might make a choice in providers based on the certifications a provider holds.</p>
<p>Other certifications that customers might consider valuable or noteworthy when selecting cloud providers include the following:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0044" class="none">

<ul id="c08-list-0045">
<li>ISO 27000 series (in particular 27017, which addresses IT security controls in a cloud environment)</li>
