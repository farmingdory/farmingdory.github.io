<p class="noindent-top">Cybersecurity is not just limited to IT systems in the enterprise. A significant number of embedded systems and specialized systems produce and consume data to achieve functionality. These systems require cybersecurity as well if their functionality is to be protected from adverse risk. This chapter covers the unique nature of these systems and how that relates to providing protection for them.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Certification Objective</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter covers CompTIA Security+ exam objective 2.6: Explain the security implications of embedded and specialized systems.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev138">Embedded Systems</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Embedded systems</em> is the name given to computers that are included as an integral part of a larger system, typically hardwired in. From computer peripherals like printers, to household devices like smart TVs and thermostats, to the car you drive, embedded systems are everywhere. Embedded systems can be as simple as a microcontroller with fully integrated interfaces (a system on a chip) or as complex as the dozens of interconnected embedded systems in a modern automobile. Embedded systems are designed with a single control purpose in mind and have virtually no additional functionality, but this does not mean that they are free of risk or security concerns. The vast majority of security exploits involve getting a device or system to do something it is capable of doing, and technically designed to do, even if the resulting functionality was never an intended use of the device or system.</p>
<p class="indent">The designers of embedded systems typically are focused on minimizing costs, with security seldom seriously considered as part of either the design or the implementation. Because most embedded systems operate as isolated systems, the risks have not been significant. However, as capabilities have increased, and these devices have become <span id="page_228" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>networked together, the risks have increased significantly. For example, smart printers have been hacked as a way into enterprises, and as a way to hide from defenders. Also, when next-generation automobiles begin to talk to each other, passing traffic and other information between them, and begin to have navigation and other inputs beamed into systems, the risks will increase and security will become an issue. This has already been seen in the airline industry, where the separation of in-flight Wi-Fi, in-flight entertainment, and cockpit digital flight control networks has become a security issue.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec304">Raspberry Pi</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>Raspberry Pi</em> is a highly successful, low-cost, single-board computer. Millions of these devices have found their way into a wide range of applications—from use by hobbyists to prototype engineers, and even as production elements in some cases. This low-cost (less than $50) highly capable computing device offers a lot of features and connectivity. A quad-core ARM processor, 8 GB of RAM, connectivity via Ethernet, Bluetooth, USB, 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi, and host of connectivity options for displays, I/O, and storage all make this a versatile platform. Securing a Raspberry Pi is similar to securing any other system. One has to consider the environment in which it will be deployed, how it is connected to other users, and what data and sensitive information is involved. Also, remember that this is, in most cases, a full Linux environment that requires permissions and other basic security elements.</p>
<p class="indent">A Raspberry Pi running a science fair project with no connectivity to the Web has a completely different scope than one that is connected to the Internet and being used to log sensitive data necessary for production in an enterprise setting. Determining the risk profiles and addressing them as appropriate is still a needed and important task.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec305">Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)</em> are electronic circuits that are programmed to perform a specific function. These semiconductor devices are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) that are connected via programmable interconnects, and in essence the logic is programmed before use. FPGAs are designed to be reprogrammed to the desired functionality requirements after manufacturing, and they can typically be reprogrammed as designs of the functionality evolve. Although not as fast as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are custom manufactured for specific design tasks, the programmability and reprogrammability capabilities of FPGAs provide significant design flexibility. FPGAs and ASICs are found in a lot of custom devices, where a full-blown computer with an operating system (OS) and all that it entails is not needed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec306">Arduino</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>Arduino</em> is a single-board microcontroller, not a full-fledged computer like the Raspberry Pi. The Arduino is simpler, designed to provide computer control to hardware projects without the overhead of a full computer, OS, and so on. While a Raspberry Pi is designed as a computer, the Arduino is designed as a controller, specifically for <span id="page_229" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>interfacing with sensors and devices. The Arduino can respond to sensor levels and actuate devices based on programming that is loaded onto the device. This coding works when power is applied; if power is lost, once it is restored, the device can begin functioning again—unlike a computer, which would have to reboot and start over. Expansion of the Arduino platform is done via a series of boards called shields that can add specific functionality in networking, display, data collection, and so on.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand static environments—systems in which the hardware, OS, applications, and networks are configured for a specific function or purpose. These systems are designed to remain unaltered through their lifecycle, rarely requiring updates.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev139">Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) / Industrial Control System (ICS)</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>SCADA</em> is an acronym for <em>supervisory control and data acquisition,</em> a system designed to control automated systems in cyber-physical environments. SCADA systems have their own smart components, each of which is an example of an embedded system. Together they form a SCADA system, which can control manufacturing plants, traffic lights, refineries, energy networks, water plants, building automation and environmental controls, and a host of other systems. A SCADA system is also known as a distributed control system (DCS) or an industrial control system (ICS), depending on the industry and the configuration. Where computers control a physical process directly, a SCADA system likely is involved.</p>
<p class="indent">Most SCADA systems involve multiple components networked together to achieve a set of functional objectives. These systems frequently include a human–machine interface (HMI), where an operator can exert a form of directive control over the operation of the system under control. SCADA systems historically have been isolated from other systems, but the isolation is decreasing as these systems are being connected across traditional networks to improve business functionality. Many older SCADA systems were air gapped from the corporate network; that is, they shared no direct network connections. This meant that data flows in and out were handled manually and took time to accomplish. Modern systems removed this constraint and added direct network connections between the SCADA networks and the enterprise IT networks. These connections increase the attack surface and the risk to the system; the more they resemble an IT networked system, the greater the need for security functions.</p>
<p class="indent">SCADA systems have been drawn into the security spotlight with the Stuxnet attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, initially reported in 2010. Stuxnet is malware designed to attack a specific SCADA system and cause failures, resulting in plant equipment damage. This attack was complex and well designed, crippling nuclear fuel processing in Iran for a significant period of time. This attack raised awareness of the risks associated with SCADA systems, whether connected to the Internet or not (Stuxnet crossed an air gap to hit its target).</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec307"><span id="page_230" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Facilities</h4>
<p class="noindent">SCADA systems find many uses in <em>facilities,</em> ranging from the building automation systems of the HVAC system, to pumps for water pressure, escalators and elevators, and fire alarms—the lists just keep going on. Many of these systems are independent systems where data is collected from sensors and used for a specific purpose (elevator scheduling based on buttons on floors, for instance). Others, such as building access controls, locked/secured doors, and fire alarm systems, may be interconnected to ensure safety under specific conditions and security under other conditions. Some of these systems are connected via the Internet for remote monitoring or control. As for all systems, understanding how to get access to a system and securing those access points is key for securing this type of SCADA employment.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec308">Industrial</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Industrial</em> facilities have some of the same needs as other facilities—the computer control of various processes, such as security, environmental monitoring, fire alarms, and more. The key element is to understand that virtually any facility has a data collection–data response system, whether it’s a simple HVAC or thermostat system or a more complex system such as a surveillance or fire alarm system. Each of these systems can stand alone, be partially integrated with other systems, fully integrated with others, or connected to the Internet; the combinations are almost endless and are tailored to meet the requirements of the facility.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec309">Manufacturing</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Manufacturing</em> systems add another layer of computer-controlled processes to the industrial/facility mix—those of the actual manufacturing process itself. Manufacturing equipment is commonly computer controlled, using devices such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), to execute a process-specific set of instructions based on sensor readings and actuator settings. These systems can be differentiated by a wide range of specific attributes, but the term SCADA is commonly used to cover them.</p>
<p class="indent">These systems may be connected to the Internet or have outside access for third-party vendors. Because the SCADA systems that are running your manufacturing are typically very critical to your enterprise, these systems require protection from attackers. The standard practice for this is one of strict network segmentation.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec310">Energy</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Energy</em> systems range from electrical to chemical, petroleum, pipelines, nuclear, solar, hydrothermal, and more. Each of these systems has multiple systems under computer control, typically using the same types of SCADA components as other categories already discussed. In the case of energy distribution, such as pipelines and electricity, a further complication is the distributed nature of these elements, where they are geographically spread out (in many cases in our communities). This distribution of components “outside the corporate walls” adds a unique physical security aspect to these systems.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec311"><span id="page_231" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Logistics</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Logistics</em> systems are the systems that move material from point A to point B. These systems can involve sea, surface (roads and rail), and air transport. There are two basic elements that will be under control: the transport system itself and the material being moved.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When examining SCADA systems, you have three things to worry about: the value of the information being protected, physical access to the system, and logical (typically network) access to the data. When examining the question, parse the question for the specific detail that matters.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev140">Internet of Things (IoT)</h3>
<p class="noindent">The <em>Internet of Things (IoT)</em> is a term used to describe a wide range of devices that connect directly via the Internet to create a distributed sensor and processing system to achieve a specific function. As opposed to general-purpose devices, like computers and networking equipment, IoT devices are purpose built; they are designed to do a specific task. All these devices have a couple similarities. They all have a network interface because connectivity is their purpose as a smart device or a member of the Internet of Things club. On that network interface is some form of compute platform. With complete computer functionality now included on the system on a chip platform (covered in a later section), these tiny devices can have a complete working computer for just a few dollars in cost. The use of a Linux-type kernel as the core engine makes programming easier, as the base of programmers is very large. These devices also can be mass produced and at relatively low cost. The scaling of the software development over literally millions of units makes costs scalable. Functionality is king, meaning that security or anything that might impact new expanded functionality has to take a backseat.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec312">Sensors</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Sensors</em> are devices that measure some physical item and return data that can be used by a system. Sensors come in an endless array of sizes, shapes, and physical constraints. Sensors can be used to measure temperatures, pressures, voltages, positions, humidity levels—the list goes on. Sensors can return the data as either a digital or analog signal. Analog sensors require an analog-to-digital conversion before the data can be used by a computer, although many interface boards do this translation automatically. When designing a system, you need to determine what needs to be measured, over what range, and at what precision, as well as environmental and other conditions; these factors all shape the specification for a sensor and determine the cost.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec313">Smart Devices</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Smart devices</em> and devices that comprise the IoT have taken the world’s markets by storm. From key fobs that can track the location of items via GPS, to cameras that can provide <span id="page_232" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>surveillance, to connected household appliances, TVs, dishwashers, refrigerators, crock pots, washers, and dryers—anything with a microcontroller now seems to be connected to the Web so that it can be controlled remotely. Artificial intelligence (AI) has also entered into the mix, enabling even greater functionality, embodied in products such as Amazon Echo, Google Home, Microsoft Cortana, and Apple Siri. Computer-controlled light switches, LED light bulbs, thermostats, and baby monitors—the smart home has become a reality, connecting everything to the Internet. You can carry a key fob that your front door recognizes, unlocking itself before you get to it. Of course, the security camera sees you first and alerts the system that someone is coming up the driveway. The only thing that can be said with confidence about this revolution is someone will figure out a how and a why to connect virtually anything to the network.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec314">Wearables</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Wearable</em> technologies include everything from biometric sensors measuring heart rate, to step counters measuring how far one walks, to smart watches that combine all these functions and more. By measuring biometric signals, such as pulse rate, and body movements, it is possible to measure fitness and even sleep. These wearable devices are built using very small computers that run a real-time operating system, usually built from a stripped-down Linux kernel. As with all information-containing devices, how does one protect the data? As wearables learn more and more of your personal data, they become a source of interest for hackers. Protecting the data is the security objective for these devices.</p>
<p class="indent">Things you can do to start protecting personal data include checking the default settings, checking the privacy settings, turning off location tracking, reading the privacy policies, and, where possible, using a passcode to protect your personal information (PI).</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec315">Facility Automation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Low-cost sensors in an IoT package offer several advantages, including but not limited to, network delivery of data, significant data collection capability, and cost advantages with scale. In large facilities, this means security systems, HVACs, fire sensors, and so on can provide large-scale coverage, enabling automation of data collection that used to be done manually via a person walking around. Automation is more than just remote operation; apps such as IFTTT (If This Then That) systems can respond to changing conditions and use multiple indicators, including dates and times. Automation can improve risk because it removes errors and improves speed of response.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec316">Weak Defaults</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whenever items are manufactured or produced in large quantities, specific specializations such as default credentials are a challenge. The typical process is to have default credentials on a device and then expect the user to change them. This expectation of a user changing credentials commonly results in poor security. <em>Weak defaults</em> are a condition where default conditions are generally known, including admin account and password, <span id="page_233" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>leaving the system completely vulnerable to an attacker. But even if the password is changed, in cases where large numbers of devices are deployed, is it reasonable to expect they all got the default credentials changed to unique passwords? One of the challenges of IoT deployment and security is managing literally thousands or millions of devices—and the credentials.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet of Things is all about connectivity of low-cost (relative) items at scale. Deployments of hundreds, thousands, and even millions of devices have been done, and the data can provide great insights that can only be seen with data at scale. However, with that scale comes the challenge of managing and securing the large number of devices.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev141">Specialized Systems</h3>
<p class="noindent">As the name indicates, <em>specialized systems</em> are systems designed for special purposes. Four primary types of specialized systems targeted by CompTIA are the systems in medical devices, vehicles, aircraft, and smart meters. Each of these categories has significant computer systems providing much of the functionality control for the device, and each of these systems has its own security issues.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec317">Medical Systems</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Medical systems</em> is a very diverse group—from small implantable devices, such as pacemakers, to multi-ton MRI machines. In between is a wide range of devices, from those that measure vital signs to those that actually control vital functions. Each of these has several interesting characteristics, and they all have an interesting caveat—they can have a direct effect on a human’s life. This makes security of these devices also a safety function.</p>
<p class="indent">Medical devices such as lab equipment and infusion pumps have been running on computer controls for years. The standard of choice has been an embedded Linux kernel that has been stripped of excess functionality and pressed into service in the embedded device. One of the problems with this approach is how to patch this kernel when vulnerabilities are found. Another, related problem is that as the base system gets updated to a newer version, the embedded system stays trapped on the old version. This requires regression testing for problems, and most manufacturers will not undertake such labor-intensive chores.</p>
<p class="indent">Medical devices are manufactured under strict regulatory guidelines that are designed for static systems that do not need patching, updating, or changes. Any change would force a requalification—a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process. As such, these devices tend to never be patched. With the advent of several high-profile vulnerabilities, including Heartbleed and Bash shell attacks, most manufacturers simply recommended that the devices be isolated and never connected to an outside network. In concept, this is fine, but in reality, this can never happen, as all the networks in a hospital or medical center are connected.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_234" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>A recent recall of nearly a half million pacemakers in 2017 for a software vulnerability that would allow a hacker to access and change the performance characteristics of the device is proof of the problem. The good news is that the devices can be updated without removing them, but it will take a doctor’s visit to have the new firmware installed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec318">Vehicle Systems</h4>
<p class="noindent">A modern <em>vehicle</em> has not a single computer in it, but actually hundreds of them, all interconnected on a bus. The controller area network (CAN) bus is designed to allow multiple microcontrollers to communicate with each other without a central host computer. Before the CAN bus was invented, individual microcontrollers were used to control the engine, emissions, transmission, braking, heating, electrical, and other systems, and the wiring harnesses used to interconnect everything became unwieldy. Robert Bosch developed the CAN bus for cars, specifically to address the wiring harness issue, and when first deployed in 1986 at BMW, the weight reduction was over 100 pounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Since 2008, all new U.S. and European cars must use a CAN bus, per SAE regulations—a mandate engineers have willingly embraced as they continue to add more and more subsystems. The CAN bus has a reference protocol specification, but recent auto hacking discoveries have shown several interesting things. First, in defending allegations that some of its vehicles could suddenly accelerate without driver action, Toyota claimed that the only way to make a vehicle accelerate quickly is to step on the gas pedal—that software alone won’t do it. However, this was proven to be false. Hackers have demonstrated almost complete control over all functions of the Toyota Prius using computers and CAN bus commands. Second, every automobile manufacturer has interpreted/ignored the reference protocol specification to varying degrees. Finally, as demonstrated by hackers at DEF CON, it is possible to disable cars in motion, over the Internet, as well as fool around with the entertainment console settings and other systems.</p>
<p class="indent">The bottom line is that, to function properly, newer vehicles rely on multiple computer systems, all operating semi-autonomously and with very little security. The U.S. Department of Transportation is pushing for vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology, so that vehicles can tell each other when traffic is changing ahead of them. Couple that with the advances in self-driving technology, and the importance of stronger security in the industry is clear. There is evidence that this is beginning, that security is improving, but the pace of improvement is slow when compared to typical computer innovation speeds.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec319">Aircraft Systems</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Aircraft</em> also have a significant computer footprint inside, as most modern jets have what is called an “all-glass cockpit,” meaning the old individual gauges and switches have been replaced with a computer display that includes a touchscreen. This enables greater functionality and is more reliable than the older systems. But as with vehicles, the connecting of all of this equipment onto busses that are then eventually connected to outside networks has led to a lot of security questions for the aviation industry. And, as is true of medical devices, patching the OS for aircraft systems is a difficult process because the <span id="page_235" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>industry is heavily regulated, with strict testing requirements. This makes for systems that, over time, will become vulnerable as the base OS has been thoroughly explored and every vulnerability mapped and exploited in non-aviation systems, and these use cases can port easily to aircraft.</p>
<p class="indent">Recent revelations have shown that the in-flight entertainment systems, on standard Linux distros, are separated from flight controls not by separate networks, but by a firewall. This has led hackers to sound the alarm over aviation computing safety.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec320">Smart Meters</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Smart meters</em> is the common name for the advanced metering infrastructure, a program initiated by the Department of Energy to bring the functionality of remote automation to meters in utilities. Real-time two-way communications, computing infrastructure to analyze the data, and a whole host of new policies and procedures to take advantage of the automation have provided a revolution in utility operations. For electricity, this means real-time (with a granularity measured in minutes, not a month like previous manual reads) usage data that enables matching of supply and demand with greater efficiency. For all utilities, the ability to read meters, change service, disconnect, reconnect, and detect and manage outages provides cost savings and levels of service never possible with the old manually managed meters. Managing the large-scale deployment of infrastructure in a secure fashion requires an extensive cryptographic setup, with some meters having multiple passwords for different levels of operation. Multiply this by millions of meters, and this is not a trivial task to manage. However, there are software packages designed to automate these elements as well.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized systems are custom built to serve a purpose, and the required level of security goes along with the purpose. If the data needs protecting, then the same problems and solutions used to fix them apply. In most specialized systems, the risks are significant and cryptographic solutions are designed into the system to limit access to authorized users.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev142">Voice over IP (VoIP)</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Voice over IP</em>—the transmission of voice communications over IP networks—is now a commonplace method of providing telephone services. VoIP makes telephone management as easy as an app in the enterprise, but it also brings security risks and vulnerabilities. VoIP systems require protections from standard traffic-based attacks such as denial of service, but also need protections from spoofing. Suppose you get an internal phone call from Ms. Jones, the company’s CFO, and your screen says “Ms. Jones,” but how do you know who is on the line? If you have never heard Ms. Jones speak before, do you trust the voice, the screen, or what? Authentication and the protection of the communication channels have been the province of the telephone company, but in VoIP there is no overarching phone company to manage these risks.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_236" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Additional risks include outsiders using your VoIP to connect to international telephony services and offering free phone calls or using your phone service to robocall people. Just as we have to secure systems like e-mail from outside, unauthorized users, we need to do the same with VoIP services.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev143">Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC)</h3>
<p class="noindent">Building-automation systems, climate-control systems, and <em>HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning)</em> systems are all examples of systems that are managed by embedded systems. Although these systems used to be independent and stand-alone systems, the rise of hyper-connectivity has shown value in integrating them. Having a “smart building” that reduces the use of building resources in accordance with the number and distribution of people inside increases efficiency and reduces costs. Interconnecting these systems and adding in Internet-based central control mechanisms does increase the risk profile from outside attacks. These outside attacks could result in HVAC malfunction or failure, rendering a major office building uninhabitable due to heat and safety.</p>
<p class="indent">Although not specific to the HVAC system in one sense, Target corporation’s 2014 hack was begun when an HVAC vendor was compromised, leading to a compromise of the Target network and access to its point-of-sale network. The story of the hack made the news and cost Target hundreds of millions of dollars and resulted in a significant number of executive changes. Cloud security service provider Qualys said that its researchers have discovered that most of about 55,000 HVAC systems connected to the Internet over the past two years have flaws that can be easily exploited by hackers.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev144">Drones</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Drones</em>, or <em>unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)</em>, represent the next frontier of flight. These machines range from the small <em>drones</em> that hobbyists can play with for under $300 to full-size aircraft that can fly across oceans. What makes these systems different from regular aircraft is that the pilot is on the ground, flying the device via remote control. UAVs have cameras, sensors, and processors to manage the information, and even the simple hobbyist versions have sophisticated autopilot functions. Because of the remote connection, UAVs are networked and operated either under direct radio control (rare) or via a networked system (much more common).</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev145">Multifunction Printers (MFPs)</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Multifunction printers (MFPs)</em>, which combine a printer, scanner, and fax, have embedded compute power to act as a print server, manage the actual printing or scanning process, and allow complete network connectivity. These devices communicate in a bidirectional fashion, accepting print jobs and sending back job status, printer status, and other information to the computer. This has decoupled printing from the computer, making the printer a stand-alone entity. The system that runs all these functions was designed to provide maximum functionality for the device, and security is more of an <span id="page_237" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>afterthought than a design element. As such, these devices have been shown to be hackable and capable of passing malware from the printer to the computer. These attacks still exist primarily as a proof of concept as opposed to a real-world threat, which is fortunate, because the current generation of security software does not monitor printer activity to and from the computer very well.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev146">Real-time Operating Systems (RTOSs)</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Real-time operating systems (RTOSs)</em> are designed for devices where the processing must occur in real time and data cannot be queued or buffered for any significant length of time. RTOSs are not general-purpose machines but are programmed for a specific purpose. They still have to deal with contention, and they have scheduling algorithms to deal with timing collisions, but in general an RTOS processes each input as it is received, or within a specific time slice defined as the response time. Examples of RTOSs range from something as common as an anti-lock braking computer system in a car to something as complex as a robotic system used on an assembly line.</p>
<p class="indent">Most general-purpose computer operating systems are capable of multitasking by design. This includes Windows and Linux. Multitasking systems make poor real-time processors, primarily because of the overhead associated with separating tasks and processes. Windows and Linux may have interrupts, but these are the exception, not the rule, for the processor. RTOS-based software is written in a completely different fashion, designed to emphasize the thread in processing rather than handling multiple threads.</p>
<p class="indent">The security implications surrounding real-time operating systems lie in their timing. Should an event do something that interferes with the system’s ability to respond within its time allotment, then the system itself can fail in its task. Real-time operating systems also tend to be specific to the degree that updates and patches tend not to be common, as the manufacturer of the system does not provide that level of support. As items such as cars become more networked, these weaknesses are becoming apparent, and one can expect this situation to change over time.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev147">Surveillance Systems</h3>
<p class="noindent">Digital <em>surveillance systems</em> have entered the computing world through a couple of different portals. First, there is the world of high-end digital cameras that have networking stacks, image processors, and even 4K video feeds. These are used in enterprises such as news organizations, which rely on getting the data live without extra processing delays. What is important to note is that most of these devices, although they are networked into other networks, have built-in virtual private networks (VPNs) that are always on, because the content is considered valuable enough to protect as a feature.</p>
<p class="indent">The next set of cameras reverses the quantity and quality characteristics. Where the high-end devices are fairly small in number, there is a growing segment of video surveillance cameras, including cameras for household surveillance, baby monitoring, and the like. Hundreds of millions of these devices are sold, and they all have a sensor, a processor, a network stack, and so forth. These are part of the Internet of Things revolution, <span id="page_238" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>where millions of devices connect together either on purpose or by happenstance. It was a network of these devices, along with a default username and password, that led to the Mirai botnet that actually broke the Internet for a while in the fall of 2016. The true root cause was a failure to follow a networking RFC concerning source addressing, coupled with the default username and password and remote configuration that enabled the devices to be taken over. Two sets of fails, working together, created weeks’ worth of problems.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VoIP, HVAC, drones/UAVs, MFPs, and surveillance systems have one weakness in common: access via the Internet. The same vector can be used against any connected system, and without defenses, these are typically very insecure systems. They have to be connected for functionality, and hence they need basic protections like passwords.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev148">System on a Chip (SoC)</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>System on a chip (SoC)</em> refers to a complete computer system miniaturized on a single integrated circuit, designed to provide the full functionality of a computing platform on a single chip. This includes networking and graphics display. Some SoC solutions come with memory, while others have the memory separate. SoCs are very common in the mobile computing market (both phones and tablets) because of their low power consumption and efficient design. Some SoC brands have become household names because mobile phone companies have advertised their inclusion in a system, such as the Snapdragon processor in Android devices. Quad-core and eight-core SoC systems are already in place, and they even have advanced designs such as quad plus one, where the fifth processor is slower and designed for simple processes and uses extremely small amounts of power. So when the quad cores are not needed, there is not significant energy usage.</p>
<p class="indent">The programming of SoC systems can occur at several different levels. Dedicated OSs and applications can be written for them, such as the Android fork of Linux, which is specific to the mobile device marketplace. Because these devices represent computing platforms with billions of devices worldwide, they have become a significant force in the marketplace. The security implications of SoC-based systems is associated not with the specifics of SoC, but in the fact that they are ubiquitous in our technology-driven lives. Security issues are handled by the device, not the specific SoC aspect itself.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev149">Communication Considerations</h3>
<p class="noindent">Embedded and specialized systems are useful for a purpose, and many times those purposes require communications across a network for other resources. The <em>communication considerations</em> for embedded and specialized systems are dependent on the service, what task it is doing, and the resources needed. The methods of communication are wide and varied, and the choice is usually dependent on the range needed and with whom the communication is needed. For short-distance, local communications, certain technologies can excel. For worldwide communications, others would work better. Adopting <span id="page_239" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>technology already employed by users has advantages as well; for instance, why use a specialty radio circuit in an environment that already has Wi-Fi?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec321">5G</h4>
<p class="noindent">5G is the latest generation mobile radio-based network. It is designed to connect virtually everyone and everything together, including machines, objects, and devices, with a focus on higher data speeds and bandwidth. 5G networks are more than just bigger pipes; the standard has many functional elements to improve both performance and efficiencies. 5G is in the process of being rolled out worldwide, and connectivity is via a cellular circuit—either a phone, modem, or a chipset designed in a product.</p>
<p class="indent">Just as having a full-blown server is overkill for a simple sensor, 5G may be overkill for many communication needs. If worldwide range, large bandwidth, and low latency are important, then 5G may be warranted, but if not, there are lower-cost alternatives.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec322">Narrow-Band Radio</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Narrow-band radio</em> communications use narrow bands of frequencies for low-data-rate communications. While a low data rate may seem to be a big problem, not all systems have high-data-rate needs, and narrow-band radio offers advantages in range and power utilization. Lower-power transmitters are the norm, as are significantly longer ranges. So, if a company has a bunch of drilling rigs over a large geographic area and needs to move relative small quantities of data between them, then narrow-band radio can be the ideal solution.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec323">Baseband Radio</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Baseband</em> refers to the original bandwidth produced by a signal. For typical audio signals, it is 20–20,000 Hz. For a signal to be transmitted over a radio circuit, it is usually encoded or modulated in a manner that can then be blended with the radio wave, carrying the information in the changes on a radio wave. <em>Baseband radio</em> refers to the signal that is being transmitted and represents a single channel of communication. Broadband radio is when multiple signals are bundled together for transmission, and equipment is typically required to separate out the individual communications. Baseband radio, by design, is very simple, as it only carries a single channel to manage communications across.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec324">Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Cards</h4>
<p class="noindent">A <em>subscriber identity module (SIM) card</em> is a device used to hold key information needed to conduct communications across telecommunication networks. A SIM card provides a means of identifying users and other key items of information when using telecommunication networks. When accessing a telecommunication network, one has to identify themselves for billing purposes. The SIM card provides the information needed by the network to attribute the call. Elements such as provider, serial numbers, and keys are stored on a universal integrated circuit card that acts as a standard for storing and <span id="page_240" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>managing this information on devices. SIM cards are important because they can contain user data and authentication information as well as provide identity services. When one moves a SIM card from one phone to another, the new hardware acts like the old hardware with respect to connectivity and, to a degree, stored data.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec325">Zigbee</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Zigbee</em> is a low-power mesh radio service used to connect sensors and basic devices.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication needs are common among a lot of devices, but the methods vary. Understanding the limitations of the different methods and the security options is important.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev150">Constraints</h3>
<p class="noindent">Specialized and embedded systems have a different set of constraints that they are designed to operate under. Typical constraints for these devices include limitations on power, compute capacity, network throughput and bandwidth, cryptography, and cost. Additional issues in items like authentication and trust can also be driving factors. As these devices are built for a specific purpose, these limitations are actually design elements and are part of the ability of the system to perform its task in the expected environment.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec326">Power</h4>
<p class="noindent">Electronic circuits take <em>power</em> to operate, and it comes from one of several sources: a power supply connected to the grid, a battery, solar, or another type of device. Power is a key driver in many embedded and specialized systems because it is a true limiter. When the power supply is interrupted and no backup power supply exists, the device stops functioning. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have come a long way in the past few years, and for mobile devices they form the primary supply. Power drives many design elements because extra functionality that is not needed, including speed, only uses power and does not add to the functionality of the unit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec327">Compute</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>compute</em> capability of embedded and specialized systems is another key component that is matched to the task the device is designed to accomplish. Compute performance is one of the major elements in the power equation, and excess compute capacity results in more power drain and less useful life on a battery charge. Microcontrollers, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), all discussed earlier in the chapter, are valid options for the compute segment of a design, and each of these comes with a wide range of capabilities. From tiny microcontrollers the size of a grain of rice with very limited capabilities, to the ASICs designed for visual/lidar processing in modern self-driving cars, the range of capabilities is wide. The key point to remember is that compute power, power capacity, and useful lifetime without external power are all locked in a battle, each taking from the other two.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec328"><span id="page_241" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Network</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Network</em> limitations are due to constraints from power and connectivity. Without direct connectivity, networking requires a radio transceiver, and this increases power demands. Therefore, where networking is needed, it comes at a cost. There are a variety of methods used for networking, and the one chosen will be the cheapest and best solution for the networking needs available at the time of system design.</p>
<p class="indent">Leaving single-unit considerations aside, networking is the key value component behind the Internet of Things revolution. The utility of networking power is related to an exponential function associated with the number of nodes. Hence, the greater the number of nodes, the larger the utility, and this growth is exponential in nature. Larger deployments (think smart meters in a major metropolitan area) deliver tremendous quantities of data, via a network, to a data center on a regular and timely basis. Managing large data flows places a burden on the central site, which if not properly planned for and executed becomes a constraint on the overall system operation.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec329">Cryptographic Functions</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Cryptographic functions</em> can be essential to secure data during transmission, but this functionality comes at a price. The level of computational resources for crypto functions can be substantial, thus becoming a constraint on the overall system. Lightweight cryptographic algorithms are being developed to specifically address these challenges, and these are covered in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>, “Cryptographic Concepts.”</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec330">Inability to Patch</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>inability to patch</em> an item represents a security risk and a constraint. This is typically caused by a series of design decisions predicated on producing items that are not computers but rather single-purpose devices. While Raspberry Pi’s and Arduinos may get patches from their developers, the embedded controller in a surveillance camera is another story altogether. Simply put, the ecosystem for most embedded devices is missing the means, the culture, and in many cases the sheer ability to manage the patch process.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec331">Authentication</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Authentication</em> is an important predicate to security functionality. The definitions of confidentiality, integrity, and many other security attributes have the term <em>authenticated user</em> in them. This make authentication an important property, but given the non-computer ecosystem in which most specialized and embedded devices function, there is a problem with directly adopting the concept of authentication. This is not as significant a limitation as it may seem, however, because unlike computers, which perform a multitude of different functions for different users, specialized and embedded systems tend to perform a singular function with an undefined user by design. There may be a need for an administrative interface for some functions, but enabling this with a simple PIN is not problematic, especially if defaults were taken into account during the design and deployment. For more information on this topic, review “Weak Defaults,” earlier in the chapter.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec332"><span id="page_242" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Range</h4>
<p class="noindent">In most cases, <em>range</em> is a function of power—one of the true limitations of many specialized and embedded systems. One of the challenges of IoT deployments is getting them to the Internet, because there range is unlimited. However, this comes at the cost of security/risk.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec333">Cost</h4>
<p class="noindent">The whole purpose behind developing specialized/embedded systems is that the value is there. The functionality return for the <em>cost</em> of the unit justifies the design and deployment, so cost is to a degree baked in. So, rather than viewing cost as a constraint, it is the factor that drives the creation of these solutions. However, cost is also an economic issue because extra functionality leads to extra cost, and if this functionality isn’t needed in the final solution, money is wasted.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec334">Implied Trust</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Implied trust,</em> by definition, is trust that has not been specifically set up but yet exists. This is almost a given in many specialized systems because they are not intended or designed to be general-purpose compute devices; therefore, the thought processes associated with regular trust vis-à-vis computers and the Internet do not exist. This makes for easier connectivity, but also opens doors for an attacker.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When questioned about constraints and specialized systems (not general-purpose computers), remember the ecosystem that the device is intended to run in and consider that when formulating the answer. Many times it is different for specialized/embedded systems than for a general-purpose computer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev151">Chapter Review</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you became acquainted with the security implications of embedded systems, which have become ubiquitous in our everyday lives. The chapter opened with a discussion of embedded systems in the form of the Raspberry Pi, field programmable gate array (FPGA), and the Arduino microcontroller platform. The chapter then presented the SCADA/ICS space and how operational technology is its own world and one of significant size. Examinations of these systems in facilities as well as industrial, manufacturing, energy, and logistics settings were covered. The chapter then moved to the world of smart devices and the Internet of Things, including sensors, smart devices, wearable technology, facility automation, and weak defaults.</p>
<p class="indent">The chapter then covered specialized systems, including medical systems, vehicles, aircraft, and smart meters. A discussion of Voice over IP, HVAC systems, drones, and <span id="page_243" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>multifunction printers followed. Next, we looked at real-time operating systems, surveillance systems, and system on a chip, followed by communication considerations for embedded and specialty systems such as 5G, narrow band, baseband, SIM cards, and Zigbee. The chapter closed with an examination of system constraints in these systems, including power, compute performance, network functions, cryptographic functions, the inability to patch, authentication, range, cost, and implied trust.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec335">Questions</h4>
