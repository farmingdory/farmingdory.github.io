but you&rsquo;re just beginning your journey as an ethical hacker. You now know the tricks and tools the bad guys use&mdash;and how to defend against the major sources of attacks (physical hacks, social engineering, search engine recon, car and IoT hacking, malware, password cracking, web server hacking, and mobile device hacking). In other words, you&rsquo;ve learned to hack yourself first! This last chapter is a quick review of the 10 most important things you can do to protect yourself and the people you care about from attacks online and in the real world.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.ugxoam70gv3j"><span class="c4">1. Realize you&rsquo;re a target.</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c5">People sometimes say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll never happen to me&rdquo; or &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I can do,&rdquo; and then they wind up becoming victims of malicious hacks. This book has shown you that it&rsquo;s surprisingly simple to hack most devices, and no one is completely safe from online threats. By taking a few smart precautions, however, you can at least avoid being an </span><span class="c5 c6">easy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;target for attackers. Knowing that you&rsquo;re a potential target&mdash;and that your personal information is valuable to the average black hat hacker&mdash;is an important first step in protecting yourself and the people you care about.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.dimsnfdpx9za"><span class="c4">2. Watch out for social engineering.</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If someone is trying to get you to do something, either online or in person, stop and think about whether it&rsquo;s in your best interest. From pushy used-car salespeople to cybercriminals to online predators, attackers use human psychology to try to trick us into doing what they want.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">Be aware of, and careful about, threats to your privacy. If someone is asking for your personal information, consider who they are really. What are they asking for, and why do they need that information? Where possible, avoid being put in the position of giving up your information altogether: block unwanted contacts and social media connections, delete suspicious emails without replying, hang up on robocalls, and delete spam SMS text messages. Any of these nuisances can be an attacker&rsquo;s way in.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5">While you&rsquo;re at it, hold yourself back from sharing too much information on social media. Before you post, snap, tweet, or share, think about who can see your posts and what they could do with that information. Pictures of yourself and your friends, places you go (</span><span class="c5 c6">never</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;post vacation photos while you&rsquo;re still on vacation), and things you like can all be used by an attacker to trick you into trusting them.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5">When in doubt, talk to someone you trust; report cybercrime to the FTC at </span><span class="c6 c10"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ftc.gov/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1679432092219564&amp;usg=AOvVaw2i94Yd9BWgnu8VuThLpJy7">https://www.ftc.gov/</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;or the FBI at </span><span class="c10 c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ic3.gov/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1679432092219863&amp;usg=AOvVaw1byYQEHGuXb8B2thAjpCUF">https://www.ic3.gov/</a></span><span class="c1">, and report cyberbullying, stalking, or harassment to your local authorities.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.414lctnes5yk"><span class="c4">3. Remember the importance of physical security and turn off devices when possible.</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Physical access is total access, so be as careful about physical security as you are about online safety. Lock your doors, protect your belongings, and be careful what you plug into your computer. If you walk away from your laptop in a coffee shop for even a few minutes, an attacker can access your files or walk off with the whole computer. A flash drive or other device plugged into your computer can be used to steal files or launch malware.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">Turn off connections to your computer, like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, when you&rsquo;re not using them. In addition to saving battery life, you&rsquo;ll be blocking attacks. The same goes for mobile devices, where you should also close apps when you&rsquo;re done with them. Turn off your computer and phone overnight if you can. You&rsquo;ll sleep better with the added peace of mind&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll lower your electric bill by a few bucks a month!</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.5oqt26y1kozt"><span class="c4">4. Always think before you click.</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re unsure about the source of an email, don&rsquo;t open any links or attachments. Examine web links carefully&mdash;or run them through VirusTotal&mdash;before clicking. Better yet, open a new browser and search for the real site rather than clicking through an email, even if it looks legit.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t download or install software over the web unless you trust the source, and even then, check it in VirusTotal or your virus scanner first. Don&rsquo;t open suspicious attachments, including Office documents, PDFs, and videos; verify the source or scan the files for viruses to be safer. And don&rsquo;t share or download illegal files or pirated software, music, or movies. Malicious hackers love to hide evil surprises in these &ldquo;free&rdquo; files.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5">Only install mobile apps from official app stores. Before installing a new app, read the list of permissions the app is asking for. A game or simple app shouldn&rsquo;t need access to your contacts, call logs, or text messages&mdash;and other than augmented-reality or location-based apps like </span><span class="c5 c6">Pok&eacute;mon Go</span><span class="c1">, an app shouldn&rsquo;t require your location. If an app asks for more permissions than you think it should need, delete it and find one that does what you want with fewer permissions.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.f3bd82mdieo6"><span class="c4">5. Use a password manager and turn on two-factor authentication.</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Most people&rsquo;s passwords can be cracked in seconds or minutes. Eight characters for a password is never enough. Use a memorable passphrase of four or more words with a mixture of character types (including letters, numbers, symbols, and even non-keyboard characters). Don&rsquo;t reuse the same password for multiple sites; even if you add numbers or special characters, it takes only a few seconds for a hacker to crack a password that&rsquo;s similar to one they already know.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5">Don&rsquo;t store passwords in a browser&mdash;remember, you can reveal those passwords with just a few clicks! Instead, use a </span><span class="c5 c6">password manager</span><span class="c1">, like KeePass, Dashlane, LastPass, or similar. A password manager randomly generates hard, complex (20+ character) passwords for all your accounts and stores them in encrypted form. You set one long passphrase to access your password manager, then let the password manager handle all the other passwords automatically so you don&rsquo;t have to remember them.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">Password managers are considered safe because they actually encrypt your passwords using military-grade encryption. This is very different from security through obscurity like we saw your browser using in Chapter 1. Rather than simply hiding your other passwords, a password manager secures them by making them unrecoverable if an attacker doesn&rsquo;t have your long passphrase. By analogy, a password manager is like putting your house key in a two-ton bulletproof safe with a 20-number combination lock anchored to your curb rather than hiding the key under your doormat. By actually encrypting your passwords before storing them, a password manager (with a good passphrase) offers real security, not just obscurity.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s just one exception to using a password manager: make sure to keep your email password separate and memorize it (rather than just storing it in the manager), just in case you ever forget the passphrase for your password manager and need to reset all of your passwords using your email. This also protects you in case someone tricks you into giving away the passphrase for your password manager&mdash;you can still reset your other passwords by having reset links sent to your email. Ultimately, you only need to remember two passphrases&mdash;one for your email and one for your password manager&mdash;and you can still have unique, almost uncrackable passwords for every account.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">For added protection in case an attacker is able to steal or guess one of your passwords, turn on two-factor authentication for your most important accounts. Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification besides your password to access your most sensitive accounts. Usually, the extra verification step involves sending a security code to your cell phone.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.mo7yi5nn4n8p"><span class="c4">6. Keep your software up-to-date.</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Turn on automatic updates for your operating system and update your browser and other apps regularly. It&rsquo;s best to run updates at least monthly. Pick a certain day of the month, like the 1st or 30th, and mark your calendar to update your desktop/laptop and all applications. Think of it as another must-do task like paying your bills. Update your phone, smart TV, and other devices as soon as you can when an update is available.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">Security patches and software updates are the first place attackers look for vulnerabilities they could exploit in older versions. Once an attacker sees that a problem has been fixed, anyone who hasn&rsquo;t downloaded that fix becomes a sitting duck. That&rsquo;s why most of the 2,000+ exploits in Kali attack older versions of software. Keeping all of your software up-to-date will eliminate over 99 percent of the known attacks on the internet.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.cciwr7msjj2t"><span class="c4">7. Protect your most sensitive data.</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t log in to sensitive accounts on a public computer or an untrusted network. Instead, do sensitive work only on your most protected computer&mdash;one that is kept in a secure location and that has a good antivirus program, firewall, up-to-date software, strong account controls, and very few installed programs. Use a complex password and secure Wi-Fi at home and check your router for unknown devices regularly, at least once a month.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5">Consider keeping your most private data, like credit card information, tax forms, and health records, off your computer altogether. Otherwise, for sensitive information on your computer that you want to protect at the maximum level possible, consider encrypting the files, or encrypt the entire hard drive of the computer you do sensitive work on. On Windows Professional edition, you can encrypt your whole hard drive with BitLocker, or you can encrypt individual files and folders by right-clicking and choosing </span><span class="c0">Advanced . . .</span><span class="c13">&#9654;</span><span class="c0">Encrypt contents to secure data</span><span class="c5">. On macOS, you can use FileVault to encrypt your hard drive by going to </span><span class="c0">System Preferences</span><span class="c13">&#9654;</span><span class="c0">Security &amp; Privacy</span><span class="c13">&#9654;</span><span class="c0">FileVault</span><span class="c5">. I won&rsquo;t go through the full steps here, but the encryption programs should guide you, and a quick web search can help if you get stuck. Open source encryption packages like VeraCrypt also let you encrypt files, folders, or entire drives with a password or passphrase in just a few steps. You can download VeraCrypt at </span><span class="c10 c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.veracrypt.fr/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1679432092224171&amp;usg=AOvVaw0nW-1M-E1HVZOXe3tnUqhe">https://www.veracrypt.fr/</a></span><span class="c1">.</span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.p3ww22zg3ht6"><span class="c16">WARNING</span></h2><p class="c20"><span class="c5 c6 c18">Be careful: if you forget the password you used to encrypt the files, you won&rsquo;t be able to access them!</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s okay to store your encryption password in a password manager to keep from forgetting it. Your files will still be completely useless to a thief who steals your hard drive or laptop or to a ransomware attacker who tries to steal data from your computer before locking it down and demanding a ransom.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.x2xzfql9uavi"><span class="c4">8. Use security software wisely.</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Keep your firewall turned on and update your antivirus software regularly. There are several free and low-cost antivirus tools out there. Research which ones stop the most malware and then update your antivirus tool weekly, or turn on automatic updates, to give it the best shot at protecting you. Firewalls and antivirus software can only protect you if they&rsquo;re turned on and up-to-date.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5">Consider using a VPN app to protect your phone or laptop while traveling or when using public Wi-Fi. A VPN, or </span><span class="c5 c6">virtual private network</span><span class="c1">, masks your identity and encrypts your data as you use the internet, so anyone spying on the network won&rsquo;t be able to see your information. With a VPN, you&rsquo;ll be more secure than most of your peers and safer from most online attacks.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.bcebavxdu9h"><span class="c4">9. Back up the data you want to keep.</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The best defense against losing data&mdash;whether from ransomware, theft, destruction, or accidental deletion&mdash;is to back it up often. Back up your files to an external hard drive weekly or monthly (depending on how stressed you&rsquo;d be if you lost a month&rsquo;s worth of data).</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s best to keep your backup drive in a separate location from your computer to avoid losing both at the same time. Or skip the hassle and use a cloud backup service for a few dollars a month. Search online for one that&rsquo;s highly rated and has the features you want and need.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.1s11ij7qwo2"><span class="c4">10. Talk with your family.</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Communicate, communicate, communicate. Make sure your kids, as well as your parents and older relatives, know the kinds of threats and attacks you&rsquo;ve learned to defend against in this book. Online criminals and predators are after their accounts and identities just like they&rsquo;re after yours. Encourage them to stop and think before answering a suspicious or threatening email, phone call, or text message. You can even offer to be their &ldquo;reality check&rdquo; if they&rsquo;re not sure what to do. Sometimes just talking about an online offer or threat can help the intended target see that it&rsquo;s a scam.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5">Parents, set appropriate limits on your kids&rsquo; screen time (based on their age), talk about online and real-world threats, and </span><span class="c5 c6">listen</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to your kids. Know who their friends are and who they&rsquo;re talking to online. Consider tracking each other&rsquo;s devices&mdash;allow your kids to track your cell phone and vice versa. Make sure they understand the dangers of oversharing online. Most importantly, encourage them to talk to you if they&rsquo;re ever unsure what to do or if they ever experience cyberbullying or harassment.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.q5zbftu6sih"><span class="c4">The Takeaway</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ve come a long way in understanding online threats. You&rsquo;ve performed real hacks in a safe, virtual environment that you built yourself. And you&rsquo;ve learned to defend yourself and protect the people you care about from computer attacks.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ve also learned some of the hottest job skills for the 21st century. There are hundreds of thousands of job openings every year in cybersecurity, and you now have real-life experience defending your devices and network from the tools that malicious hackers use.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">Use this knowledge for good, be safe, and have fun hacking and practicing your new cybersecurity skills!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12"></span></p></body></html>
