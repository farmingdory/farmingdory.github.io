<p>The CCSP is not a certification of basic computer skills or training; it is a professional certification for practitioners with some background in the field. (ISC)<sup>2</sup> expects that those who want to earn this particular certification already have experience in the industry; have been employed in an InfoSec position in some professional capacity; and have a thorough understanding of many basic areas related to computers, security, business, risk, and networking. Many people taking the test already have other certifications that validate their knowledge and experience, such as the CISSP. Therefore, this book will not contain many of the basics that, while testable, you are already expected to know. If you aren’t coming from a CISSP background, it would be good to supplement your knowledge with CISSP-focused materials as well.</p>
<p>However, the CCSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) contains terminology and concepts that may be expressed in specific ways, to include perspectives and usages that may be unique to the CCSP and different from what you are used to dealing with in your current operations. This chapter is therefore intended as a guide, laying down the foundation for understanding the rest of the material and the CBK as a whole.</p>

<h2><a id="usec0002"></a>Cloud Characteristics</h2>
<p>Cloud computing has come to mean many things, but the following characteristics have become part of the generally accepted definition:</p>
<ul id="c01-list-0002">
<li>Broad network access</li>
<li>On-demand self-service</li>
<li>Resource pooling</li>
<li>Rapid elasticity</li>
<li>Measured or “metered” service</li>
</ul>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="3" id="Page_3"></span>These traits are expressed succinctly in the NIST definition of cloud computing.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c01-feafxd-0002">
<p class="h4" style="background-color: #E7E7E8;">NIST 800-145 Cloud Computing Definition</p>
<p>The official NIST definition of cloud computing says, “Cloud Computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”</p>
</section>
<p>These characteristics are also similar to how cloud computing is defined in ISO 17788 (<a class="codeLabel" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=60544">www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=60544</a>).</p>
<p>You can expect to see mention of each of these throughout this book, the CBK, and the exam.</p>
<p>Broad network access means services are consistently accessible by standard means, such as the use of a web browser to access a Software as a Service (SaaS) application regardless of the user’s location or choice of computer OS, browser, and so on. This is generally accomplished with the use of such technologies as advanced routing techniques, load balancers, and multisite hosting, among others.</p>
<p>On-demand self-service refers to the model that allows customers to scale their compute and/or storage needs with little or no intervention from or prior communication with the provider. The services happen in real time.</p>
<p>Resource pooling is the characteristic that allows the cloud provider to meet various demands from customers while remaining financially viable. The cloud provider can make capital investments that greatly exceed what any single customer could provide on their own and can apportion these resources as needed so that the resources are not underutilized (which would mean a wasteful investment) or overtaxed (which would mean a decrease in level of service). This is often referred to as a multitenant environment; multiple customers share the same underlying hardware, software, and networking assets.</p>
<p>Rapid elasticity allows the customer to grow or shrink the IT footprint (number of users, number of machines, size of storage, and so on) as necessary to meet operational needs without excess capacity. In the cloud, this can be done in moments, as opposed to the traditional environment, where acquisition and deployment of resources (or dispensing old resources) can take weeks or months.</p>
<p>Finally, measured or metered service simply means that the customer is charged for only what they use and nothing more. This is much like how a water or power company might charge you each month for the services used (with perhaps a minimum monthly charge for maintaining the connection).</p>
<p>Rest assured—we will be going into more detail regarding all of these concepts in the chapters to come.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c01-feafxd-0003">
<p class="h4" style="background-color: #E7E7E8;"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="4" id="Page_4"></span><img src="public/real.png" alt="Image of Real World Scenario" width="234" height="36"><br> Online Shopping</p>
<p>Think of retail demand during the pre-holiday crush toward the end of the year. The sheer volume of customers and transactions greatly exceeds all normal operations throughout the rest of the year. When this happens, retailers who offer online shopping can see great benefit from hosting their sales capability in the cloud. The cloud provider can apportion resources necessary to meet this increased demand and will charge for this increased usage at a negotiated rate, but when shopping drops off after the holiday, the retailers will not continue to be charged at the higher rate.</p>

<h2><a id="usec0003"></a>Business Requirements</h2>
<p>The IT department is not a profit center; it provides a support function. This is even more accurate to describe the security department. Security activities actually hinder business efficiency (because, generally, the more secure something is, be it a device or a process, the less efficient it will be). This is why the business needs of the organization drive security decisions and not the other way around.</p>
<p>A successful organization will gather as much information about operational business requirements as possible; this information can be used for many purposes, including several functions in the security realm (I’ll touch on this throughout the book, but a few examples include the business continuity/disaster recovery effort, the risk management plan, and data categorization). Likewise, the astute security professional needs to understand as much as possible about the operation of the organization. Operational aspects of the organization can help security personnel better perform their tasks no matter what level or role they happen to be assigned to. Consider the following examples:</p>
<ul id="c01-list-0003">
<li>A network security administrator has to know what type of traffic to expect based on the business of the organization.</li>
<li>The intrusion detection analyst has to understand what the organization is doing, how business activities occur, and where (geographically) the business is operating to better understand the nature and intensity of potential external attacks and how to adjust baselines accordingly.</li>
<li>The security architect has to understand the various needs of the organizational departments to enhance their operation without compromising their security profile.</li>
</ul>
<section class="feature3" id="c01-feafxd-0004">
<p><b>functional requirements:</b> Those performance aspects of a device, process, or employee that are necessary for the business task to be accomplished. Example: A salesperson in the field must be able to connect to the organization’s network remotely.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="5" id="Page_5"></span><b>nonfunctional requirements:</b> Those aspects of a device, process, or employee that are not necessary for accomplishing a business task but are desired or expected. Example: The salesperson’s remote connection must be secure.</p>
</section>
<p>Many organizations are currently considering moving their network operations to a cloud-based motif. This is not a decision made lightly, and the business requirements must be supported by this transition. There are also different cloud service and delivery models of cloud computing, and an organization must decide which one will optimize success.</p><section id="c01-sec-0004">
<h3><a id="usec0004"></a>Existing State</h3>
<p>A true evaluation and understanding of the business processes, assets, and requirements is essential. Failing to properly capture the full extent of the business needs could result in not having an asset or capability in the new environment after migration to the cloud.</p>
<p>At the start of this effort, however, the intent is not to determine what will best fulfill the business requirements but to determine what those requirements are. A full inventory of assets, processes, and requirements is necessary, and there are various methods for collecting this data. Typically, several methods are used jointly as a means to reduce the possibility of missing something.</p>
<p>Here are some possible methods for gathering business requirements:</p>
<ul id="c01-list-0004">
<li>Interviewing functional managers</li>
<li>Interviewing users</li>
<li>Interviewing senior management</li>
<li>Surveying customers</li>
<li>Collecting network traffic</li>
<li>Inventorying assets</li>
<li>Collecting financial records</li>
<li>Collecting insurance records</li>
<li>Collecting marketing data</li>
<li>Collecting regulatory mandates</li>
</ul>
<p>After sufficient data has been collected, a detailed analysis is necessary. This is the point where a business impact analysis (BIA) takes place.</p>
<p>The BIA is an assessment of the priorities given to each asset and process within the organization. A proper analysis should consider the effect (impact) any harm or loss of each asset might mean to the organization overall. During the BIA, special care should be paid to identifying critical paths and single points of failure. You also need to determine the costs of compliance—that is, the legislative and contractual requirements mandated for your organization. Your organization’s regulatory restrictions will be based on many variables, including the jurisdictions where your organization operates, the industry the organization is in, the types and locations of your customers, and so on.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c01-feafxd-0005">
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="6" id="Page_6"></span><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> Assets can be tangible or intangible. They can include hardware, software, intellectual property, personnel, processes, and so on. An example of tangible assets would be things like routers and servers, whereas intangible assets are generally something you cannot touch, such as software code, expressions of ideas, and business methodologies.</p>

<h3><a id="usec0005"></a>Quantifying Benefits and Opportunity Cost</h3>
<p>Once you have a clear picture of what your organization does in terms of lines of business and processes, you can get a better understanding of what benefits the organization might derive from cloud migration as well as the costs associated with the move.</p>
<p>Obviously, the greatest driver pushing organizations toward cloud migration at the moment is perceived cost savings, and that is a significant and reasonable consideration. The next few sections describe some aspects of that consideration.</p><section id="c01-sec-0006">
<h4><a id="usec0006"></a>Reduction in Capital Expenditure</h4>
<p>If your organization buys a device for use in its internal environment, the capacity of that device will either be fully utilized or (more likely) not. If the device is used at its fullest capacity, then it’s quite likely that the function for which it is needed may experience inefficiencies at some point. Even a small uptick in demand for that device will overload its capacity. However, if the device is not fully utilized, then the organization has paid for something for which it is getting less than full value. The unused or excess capacity goes to waste. In effect, the organization has overpaid for the device unless the organization uses the device to the point where it is dangerously close to overload—you cannot buy just part of a device.</p>
<p>Moreover, tax benefits that can be realized from the purchase of a device have to be accrued over years of operation, as depreciation of that device/asset. With a paid service (such as cloud), an operational expenditure, the entire payment (perhaps monthly or quarterly) is tax deductible as an expense.</p>
<p>In the cloud, however, the organization is only paying for what it uses (regardless of the number of devices, or fractions of devices, necessary to handle the load), and no more. This is the <i>metered service</i> aspect described earlier. As a result, the organization does not overpay for these assets. However, cloud providers do have excess capacity available to be apportioned to cloud customers, so your organization is always in a position to experience increased demand (even dramatic, rapid, and significant demand) and not be overwhelmed (this is the <i>rapid elasticity</i> aspect described earlier).</p>
<p>One way an organization can use hosted cloud services is to augment internal, private data center capabilities with managed services during times of increased demand. We refer to this as <i>cloud bursting</i>. The organization might have data center assets it owns, but it can’t handle the increased demand during times of elevated need (crisis situations, heavy holiday shopping periods, and so on), so it rents the additional capacity as needed from an external cloud provider. See <a id="figureanchor1-1" role="doc-backlink" href="Chapter 1 Architectural Concepts _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html#figure1-1">Figure 1.1</a>.</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="7" id="Page_7"></span><span class="figureLabel"><a id="figure1-1" role="doc-backlink" href="Chapter 1 Architectural Concepts _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html#figureanchor1-1"><b>Figure 1.1</b></a> Rapid scalability allows the customer to dictate the volume of resource usage.</span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Therefore, with deployment to a cloud environment, the organization realizes cost savings immediately (not paying for unused resources) and avoids a costly risk (the possibility of loss of service due to increased demand).</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0007">
<h4><a id="usec0007"></a>Reduction in Personnel Costs</h4>
<p>For most organizations (other than those that deliver IT services), managing data is not a core competency, much less a profitable line of business. Data management is also a specialized skill, and people with IT experience and training are relatively expensive (compared to employees in other departments). The personnel required to fulfill the needs of an internal IT environment represent a significant and disproportionally large investment for the organization. In moving to the cloud, the organization can largely divest itself of a large percentage, if not a majority, of these personnel.</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0008">
<h4><a id="usec0008"></a>Reduction in Operational Costs</h4>
<p>Maintaining and administering an internal environment takes a great deal of effort and expense. When an organization moves to the cloud, the cost becomes part of the price of the service, as calculated by the cloud provider. Therefore, costs are lumped in with the flat-rate cost of the contract and will not increase in response to enhanced operations (scheduled updates, emergency response activities, and so on).</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0009">
<h4><a id="usec0009"></a>Transferring Some Regulatory Costs</h4>
<p>Some cloud providers may offer holistic, targeted regulatory compliance packages for their customers. For instance, the cloud provider might have a set of controls that can be applied to a given customer’s cloud environment to ensure the mandates of Payment Card Industry (PCI) are met. Any customer wanting that package can specify so in a <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="8" id="Page_8"></span>service contract instead of trying to delineate individual controls à la carte. In this manner, the cloud customer can decrease some of the effort and expense they might otherwise incur in trying to come up with a control framework for adhering to the relevant regulations.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c01-feafxd-0006">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/tip.jpg" alt="Image of Tip" width="52" height="43"> We will go into more detail about service-level agreements, or service contracts, in later chapters.</p>
</section>
<p>It is, however, crucial to note here (and I’ll repeat it throughout the book) that under current laws, no cloud customer can transfer risk or liability associated with the inadvertent or malicious disclosure of <i>personally identifiable information (PII)</i>. This is very, very important to understand: your organization, if it holds PII of any kind, is ultimately responsible for any breaches or releases of that data, even if you are using a cloud service and the breach/release results from negligence or attack on the part of the cloud provider. Legally and financially, in the eyes of the court, your organization is always responsible for any unplanned release of PII.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c01-feafxd-0007">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> PII is a major component of regulatory compliance, whether the regulation comes in the form of statutes or contractual obligation. Protection of PII will be a large part of our security concern in the cloud.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="c01-sec-0010">
<h4><a id="usec0010"></a>Reduction in Costs for Data Archival/Backup Services</h4>
<p>Off-site backups are standard practice for both long-term data archival and disaster recovery purposes. Having a cloud-based service for this purpose is sensible and cost-efficient even if the organization does not conduct its regular operations in the cloud. However, moving operations into the cloud can create an economy of scale when combined with the archiving/backup usage; this can lead to an overall cost savings for the organization. It can enhance the business continuity/disaster recovery (BC/DR) strategy for the organization as well.</p></section>

<p>All of these benefits can be enumerated according to dollar value: each potential cost-saving measure can be quantified. Senior management—with input from subject matter experts—needs to balance the potential financial benefits against the risks of operating in the cloud. It is this cost-benefit calculation, driven by business needs but informed by security concerns, that will allow senior management to decide whether a cloud migration of the organization’s operational environment makes sense.</p>

<h2><a id="usec0012"></a>Cloud Evolution, Vernacular, and Models</h2>
<p>The arrival of the cloud and its related technology has provided a lot of advantages. To incorporate the cloud and these advantages, it is necessary to understand new terminology and how it relates to the terminology of traditional models. This new technology and its terminology are an integral part of understanding cloud computing service models and cloud computing deployment models.</p><section id="c01-sec-0013">
<h3><a id="usec0013"></a>New Technology, New Options</h3>
<p>Fifteen, or even 10, years ago, suggesting that organizations hand off their data and operations to a third party that is geographically distant and run by people that most managers in the organization will never meet would have seemed absurd, especially from a security perspective. The risk would have been seen as insurmountable, and ceding that level of control to an outside vendor would have been daunting. Today, a combination of technological capabilities and contractual trust make cloud computing not only appealing but almost a foregone conclusion, in terms of financial viability.</p>
<p>Several characteristics are emblematic of cloud computing:</p>
<ul id="c01-list-0005">
<li><b>Elasticity:</b> Rather than constantly purchasing computers, servers, data storage systems, and other resources and internally maintaining their infrastructure, an organization can contract with a cloud vendor. The cloud provider uses virtualization to flexibly allocate only the needed usage of each resource to the organization, thus holding down costs while maintaining profitability. This also allows users to access their data from diverse platforms and locations, increasing portability, accessibility, and availability.</li>
<li><b>Simplicity:</b> Proper cloud implementations allow a user to seamlessly use the service without frequently interacting with the cloud service provider.</li>
<li><b>Scalability:</b> In general, increasing or reducing services can be more easily, quickly, and cost-effectively accomplished than in a non-cloud environment.</li>

<h4 style="background-color: #E7E7E8;"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="10" id="Page_10"></span>The Difference Between a Cloud Customer and a Cloud User</h4>
<p>A <i>cloud customer</i> is anyone purchasing a cloud service (which could be an individual or a company), whereas a <i>cloud user</i> is just someone using cloud services. It could be an employee of a company that is a cloud customer or just a private individual.</p>
<p>For instance, Company A purchases SaaS services from Cloud Provider X. Company A is a cloud customer. All employees of Company A are cloud users, because they’re using the cloud services their employer, a cloud customer, has purchased for their usage.</p>

<h3><a id="usec0014"></a>Cloud Computing Service Models</h3>
<p>Cloud services are often offered in terms of three general models, based on what the vendor offers and the customer needs and the responsibilities of each according to the service contract. (ISC)<sup>2</sup> expects you to understand these three models for testing purposes. These models are <i>infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</i>, <i>platform as a service (PaaS)</i>, and <i>software as a service (SaaS)</i>, as shown in <a id="figureanchor1-2" role="doc-backlink" href="Chapter 1 Architectural Concepts _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html#figure1-2">Figure 1.2</a>. In the following sections, we’ll review each of them in turn.</p>
<figure>

<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> Some vendors and consultants demonstrate a lot of zeal in capitalizing on the popularity of the “cloud” concept and incorporate the word into every term they can think of in order to make their products more appealing. We see a broad proliferation of such labels as networking as a service (NaaS), compliance as a service (CaaS), and data science as a service (DSaaS), but they’re mostly just marketing techniques. The only service models you’ll need to know for both the exam and your use as a practitioner are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.</p>
</section>
<section id="c01-sec-0015">
<h4><a id="usec0015"></a><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="11" id="Page_11"></span>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h4>
<p>The most basic of cloud service offerings, IaaS allows the customer to install all software, including operating systems (OSs), on hardware housed and connected by the cloud vendor. In this model, the cloud provider has a data center with racks, machines, cables, and utilities and administers all these things. However, all logical resources, such as software, are the responsibility of the customer.</p>
<p>In traditional terms, we might think of this as what used to be considered a “warm site” for BC/DR purposes: the physical space exists, the connectivity exists, and it is available for the customer organization to fill with any type of baseline configuration and populate with any data the customer requires.</p>
<p>IaaS might be optimum for organizations that want enhanced control over the security of their data or are looking to the cloud for a limited purpose, such as BC/DR or archiving. It is usually the least expensive cloud option, in terms of what the customer pays the provider. However, the customer will retain certain capabilities and requirements, such as IT staffing, that may make it difficult to ascertain the true total overall cost.</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0016">
<h4><a id="usec0016"></a>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h4>
<p>PaaS contains everything included in IaaS with the addition of OSs. The cloud vendor usually offers a selection of OSs so that the customer can use any or all of the available choices. The vendor will be responsible for patching, administering, and updating the OS as necessary, and the customer can install any software they deem useful.</p>
<p>This model is especially useful for customers involved in software development, as the customer can test their software in an isolated environment without risk of damaging production capabilities and determine the viability of the software across a range of OS platforms.</p>
<p>PaaS also includes cloud-based database engines and services as well as “big data”–style services, such as data warehousing and datamining. The provider offers access to the backend engine/functionality, while the customer can create/install various apps/APIs to access the backend.</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0017">
<h4><a id="usec0017"></a>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h4>
<p>SaaS includes everything in IaaS and PaaS with the addition of software programs. The cloud vendor becomes responsible for administering, patching, and updating this software as well. The cloud customer is basically only involved in uploading and processing data on a full production environment hosted by the provider.</p>
<p>There are many examples of SaaS configurations, ranging across a spectrum of functionality. Google Docs, Microsoft’s Office 365, and QuickBooks Online are all examples of SaaS products. The provider takes care of all the infrastructure, compute, and storage needs as well as providing the underlying operating systems and the application itself. All of this is completely transparent to the end user, who only sees the application they have purchased/accessed.</p></section>

<h3><a id="usec0018"></a><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="12" id="Page_12"></span>Cloud Deployment Models</h3>
<p>In addition to viewing cloud offerings in terms of what levels of service are involved, another perspective has to do with ownership. You’ll be expected to know the facets of both sets of models.</p><section id="c01-sec-0019">
<h4><a id="usec0019"></a>Public</h4>
<p>The public cloud is what we typically think of when discussing cloud providers. The resources (hardware, software, facilities, and staff) are owned and operated by a vendor and sold, leased, or rented to anyone (offered to the public—hence the name). Public clouds are <i>multitenant</i> environments; multiple customers will share the underlying resources that are owned and operated by the provider. That means that a customer in a public cloud might be using a virtual machine that actually resides on the same hardware that hosts another virtual machine operated by the customer’s direct competitor, and the customer has no way of knowing what other entities are using the same resources.</p>
<p>Examples of public cloud vendors include Rackspace, Microsoft’s Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0020">
<h4><a id="usec0020"></a>Private</h4>
<p>A private cloud is typified by resources dedicated to a single customer; no other customers will share the underlying resources (hardware and perhaps software). Therefore, private clouds are <i>not</i> multitenant environments.</p>
<p>Private clouds can take various forms. A private cloud might be owned and maintained by the entity that is the sole customer. In other words, an organization might own and operate a data center that serves as the cloud environment for that organization’s users. Or a private cloud might be a set of resources (racks, blades, software packages) owned by the single customer but located and maintained at the cloud provider’s data center; the cloud provider might offer physical security, some basic administration services, and proper utilities (power, Internet connectivity) for the customer’s resources. This is sometimes referred to as a <i>co-lo</i> (co-located) environment.</p>
<p>Another private cloud option is for the customer to contract with a cloud provider such that the provider offers exclusive use of specific resources for that customer inside what otherwise would be a public cloud. Basically, the provider carves out a physical and logical section of the overall data center so that the customer will not share any of the resources in that section with any other customers. Obviously, the customer must pay a premium for this type of service (more than what public cloud customers, in a multitenant environment, would pay).</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0021">
<h4><a id="usec0021"></a>Community</h4>
<p>A community cloud features infrastructure and processing owned and operated by (or for) an affinity group; disparate pieces might be owned or controlled by individuals or distinct organizations, but they come together in some fashion to perform joint tasks and functions.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="13" id="Page_13"></span>Gaming communities might be considered community clouds. For instance, the PlayStation network involves many different entities coming together to engage in online gaming: Sony hosts the identity and access management (IAM) tasks for the network, a particular game company might host a set of servers that run information rights management (IRM) functions and processing for a specific game, and individual users conduct some of their own processing and storage locally on their own PlayStations. In this type of community cloud, ownership of the underlying technologies (hardware, software, and so on) is spread throughout the various members of the community.</p>
<p>A community cloud can also be provisioned by a third party on behalf of the various members of the community. For instance, a cloud provider might offer a FedRAMP cloud service, for use only by US federal government customers. Any number of federal agencies might subscribe to this cloud service (say, the Department of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, the Department of the Interior, and so on), and they will all use underlying infrastructure that is dedicated strictly for their use. Any customer that is not a US federal agency will not be allowed to use this service as non-governmental entities are not part of this particular community. The cloud provider owns the underlying infrastructure, but it’s provisioned and made available solely for the use of the specific community.</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0022">
<h4><a id="usec0022"></a>Hybrid</h4>
<p>A hybrid cloud, of course, contains elements of the other models. For instance, an organization might want to retain some private cloud resources (say, their legacy production environment, which is accessed remotely by their users) but also lease some public cloud space as well (maybe a PaaS function for software development/testing, away from the production environment so that there is much less risk of crashing operational systems).</p></section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="c01-sec-0023">
<h2><a id="usec0023"></a>Cloud Computing Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Various entities are involved in cloud service arrangements:</p>
<p><b>Cloud Service Provider (CSP), or Cloud Provider or Provider </b>The vendor offering cloud services. The CSP will own the data center, employ the staff, own and manage the resources (hardware and software), monitor service provision and security, and provide administrative assistance for the customer and the customer’s data and processing needs. Examples include Amazon Web Services, Rackspace, and Microsoft’s Azure.</p>
<p><b>Cloud Customer </b>The organization purchasing, leasing, or renting cloud services.</p>
<p><b>Cloud Broker </b>A company that purchases hosting services from a cloud provider who then resells them to its own customers.</p>
<p><b>Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) </b>A third-party entity offering independent identity and access management (IAM) services to CSPs and cloud customers, often as an <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="14" id="Page_14"></span>intermediary. This can take the form of a variety of services, including single sign-on, certificate management, and cryptographic key escrow.</p>
<p><b>Regulators </b>The entities that ensure organizations are in compliance with the regulatory framework for which they’re responsible. These can be government agencies, certification bodies, or parties to a contract. Regulations include the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX), and so forth. Regulators include the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and auditors commissioned to review compliance with contracted or asserted standards (such as PCI DSS and ISO), among many others.</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0024">
<h2><a id="usec0024"></a>Cloud Computing Definitions</h2>
<p>Because cloud definitions are at the heart of understanding the following chapters and applying security fundamentals for the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP), I have included some of those definitions here.</p>
<p><b>Business Requirement </b>An operational driver for decision-making and input for risk management.</p>
<p><b>Cloud App (Cloud Application) </b>The phrase used to describe a software application accessed via the Internet; may include an agent or applet installed locally on the user’s device.</p>
<p><b>Cloud Architect </b>Subject matter expert for cloud computing infrastructure and deployment.</p>
<p><b>Cloud Backup </b>Backing up data to a remote, cloud-based server. As a form of cloud storage, cloud backup data is stored in an accessible form from multiple distributed resources that make up a cloud.</p>
<p><b>Cloud Computing </b>The use of computing, storage, and network resources with the capabilities of rapid elasticity, metered service, broad network access, and pooled resources.</p>
<p><b>Cloud Migration </b>The process of transitioning all or part of a company’s data, applications, and services from on-site premises to the cloud, where the information can be provided over the Internet on an on-demand basis.</p>
<p><b>Cloud Portability </b>The ability to move applications and associated data between one cloud provider and another or between legacy and cloud environments.</p>
<p><b>Cost-Benefit Analysis </b>This is comparing the potential positive impact (such as profit, efficiency, market share, and so on) of a business decision to the potential negative impact (expense, detriment to production, risk, and so on) and weighing whether the two are equivalent or if the potential positive effect outweighs the potential negative. This is a business decision, not a security decision, and it is best made by managers or business analysts. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="15" id="Page_15"></span>However, in order to make an informed decision, the parties involved must be provided sufficient insight and knowledge. In security matters, the CCSP should apprise management of particular risks and benefits of alternatives related to each.</p>
<p><b>FIPS 140-2 </b>A NIST document that describes the process for accrediting and cryptosystems for use by the US federal government.</p>
<p><b>Managed Service Provider </b>An IT service where the customer dictates both the technology and operational procedures, and an external party executes administration and operational support according to a contract. A managed service provider might maintain and administer a data center/network for an organization at that organization’s business location, or in the cloud.</p>
<p><b>Multitenant </b>Multiple customers using the same public cloud (and often the same hosts, in a virtualized cloud environment).</p>
<p><b>NIST 800-53 </b>A guidance document with the primary goal of ensuring that appropriate security requirements and controls are applied to all US federal government information in information management systems.</p>
<p><b>Trusted Cloud Initiative (TCI) Reference Model </b>The TCI reference model is a guide for cloud providers, allowing them to create a holistic architecture (including the physical facility of the data center, the logical layout of the network, and the processes necessary to utilize both) that cloud customers can purchase and use with comfort and confidence. For more information, visit <a class="codeLabel" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TCI-Reference-Architecture-v1.1.pdf">https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TCI-Reference-Architecture-v1.1.pdf</a>.</p>
<p><b>Vendor Lock-in </b>Vendor lock-in occurs in a situation where a customer may be unable to leave, migrate, or transfer to an alternate provider due to technical or nontechnical constraints.</p>
<p><b>Vendor Lock-out </b>Vendor lock-out occurs when a customer is unable to recover or access their own data due to the cloud provider going into bankruptcy or otherwise leaving the market.</p>
<p>The successful CCSP candidate will be familiar with each of these terms. I will go into more detail regarding these terms over the course of the book.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c01-feafxd-0012">
<p class="h4" style="background-color: #E7E7E8;">Back to Basics</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember all the security fundamentals used throughout the industry. For instance, the familiar CIA triad will be mentioned extensively throughout the CBK, the exam, and this book.</p>
<ul id="c01-list-0006">
<li><b>Confidentiality:</b> Protecting information from unauthorized access/dissemination</li>
<li><b>Integrity:</b> Ensuring that information is not subject to unauthorized modification</li>
<li><b>Availability:</b> Ensuring that authorized users can access the information when they are permitted to do so</li>

<h2><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="16" id="Page_16"></span><a id="usec0025"></a>Foundational Concepts of Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>There are some aspects of cloud computing that are pervasive throughout all discussion of the topic. I’m introducing them here, and you should become familiar with them. These concepts will be included in various discussions throughout the book.</p><section id="c01-sec-0026">
<h3><a id="usec0026"></a>Sensitive Data</h3>
<p>Each organization will have its own risk appetite and desire for confidentiality. No matter how each cloud customer makes their own determination for these aspects of their data, the cloud provider must offer some way for the customer to categorize data according to its sensitivity and sufficient controls to ensure these categories are protected accordingly.</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0027">
<h3><a id="usec0027"></a>Virtualization</h3>
<p>Virtualization is one of the technologies that has made cloud services a financially viable business model. Cloud providers can purchase and deploy a sufficient number of host devices for a respective number of customers and users without wasting capacity or letting resources go idle.</p>
<p>In a virtualized environment, a cloud user can access a synthetic computer. To the user, there is no appreciable difference between the virtual machine (VM) and a traditional computer. However, from the provider’s perspective, the VM being offered to the user is just a piece of software, not an actual, dedicated piece of hardware being exclusively operated by the user. Indeed, there may be several, or even dozens, of VMs operating on a single host in the cloud space concurrently. When the user logs off or shuts down, the cloud network takes a snapshot of the user’s VM, capturing it as a single file that can be stored somewhere else in the cloud until the user next requests access, when the VM can be restored exactly as they left it.</p>
<p>In this way, the cloud provider can offer services to any number of customers and users and not be required to purchase a new hardware device for each new user. This economy of scale allows the cloud provider to offer the same basic IT services that the users expect from traditional networks with much less cost and at an enhanced level of service.</p>
<p>There are many virtualization product vendors, including VMware and Microsoft. There are also a variety of implementation strategies and two fundamental virtualization types (Type 1 and Type 2). These are described in the section “Virtualization” in <a href="Chapter 5 Security in the Cloud _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html">Chapter 5</a>.</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0028">
<h3><a id="usec0028"></a>Encryption</h3>
<p>As an IT security professional, you should already be familiar with the basic concepts and tools of encryption. However, in terms of cloud services, encryption plays an enhanced role and presents some additional challenges.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="17" id="Page_17"></span>Because your cloud data will be in an environment controlled and operated by personnel outside your organization, encryption offers a degree of assurance that nobody without authorization will be able to access your data in a meaningful way. You can encrypt your data before it reaches the cloud and only decrypt it as necessary.</p>
<p>Another concern related to cloud operation is that it necessitates remote access. As with any remote access, there will always be a risk (however great or slight) of interception of data, eavesdropping, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Encryption also assists in alleviating this concern by mitigating this threat to some degree; if data in motion is encrypted, it is that much more difficult to access even if it is intercepted.</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0029">
<h3><a id="usec0029"></a>Auditing and Compliance</h3>
<p>Cloud services pose specific challenges and opportunities for regulatory compliance and auditing.</p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, service providers may be able to offer holistic solutions for organizations under particular regulatory schema. For instance, the cloud provider may have an extant, known, tested control set and procedural outline for creating virtual machines that comply with PCI, HIPAA, or GLBA requirements. This could be extremely appealing to potential customers, as the difficulty and effort expended in trying to stay compliant can now be shifted out of the customer organization and over to the provider.</p>
<p>Conversely, auditing becomes more difficult. Cloud providers are extremely reluctant to allow physical access to their facilities or to share network diagrams and lists of controls; maintaining confidentiality of these things enhances the provider’s overall security. However, these are essential elements of an audit. Also, as you’ll see in upcoming chapters, it is difficult to determine exactly where (both physically and logically) in the cloud environment a given organization’s data is located at any moment or which devices contain a certain customer’s data, making auditing even more difficult. Audits will require the cooperation of the cloud provider, and providers have thus far disallowed the requisite level of access for the purpose. Instead, cloud providers often offer an assertion of their own audit success (Service Organization Control [SOC] Type 3 reports, which are discussed in <a href="Chapter 6 Responsibilities in the Cloud _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html">Chapter 6</a> and <a href="Chapter 10 Legal and Compliance Part 1 _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html">Chapter 10</a>). Any organization considering cloud migration should confer with regulators in order to determine if migration will be allowed and/or if additional measures will be required to protect regulated data.</p></section>
<section id="c01-sec-0030">
<h3><a id="usec0030"></a>Cloud Service Provider Contracts</h3>
<p>The business arrangement between the cloud provider and the cloud customer will usually take the form of a contract, which will include a service-level agreement (SLA). The contract will spell out all the terms of the agreement: what each party is responsible for, what form the services will take, how issues will be resolved, and so on. The SLA will set specific, quantified goals for these services and their provision over a certain timeframe.</p>
<p>For instance, the contract might stipulate that “the Provider will ensure the Customer has constant, uninterrupted access to the Customer’s data storage resources.” The SLA <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="18" id="Page_18"></span>will then explicitly define the metrics for what “constant, uninterrupted access” will mean: “There will be no interruption of connectivity to data storage longer than three (3) seconds per calendar month.” The contract will also state what the penalties are (usually financial) when the cloud provider fails to meet the SLA for a given period: “Customer’s monthly fee will be waived for any period following a calendar month in which any service level has not been attained by Provider.”</p>
<p>These are obviously rough examples, but they demonstrate the relationship between the contract, the SLA, the cloud provider, and the cloud customer. The book will continually refer to the contract and the SLA based on the relationship explained here.</p></section>

<section id="c01-sec-0031">
<h2><a id="usec0031"></a>Related and Emerging Technologies</h2>
<p>It is worth mentioning some emerging and related technologies. These technologies are explicitly listed in the (ISC)2 Exam Outline, and therefore of concern to the CCSP candidate.</p>
<ul id="c01-list-0007">
<li><b>Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI):</b> Machine learning and AI both refer to the concept of programs and machines being able to acquire, process, correlate, and interpret information and then apply that in various capabilities without needing direct input from users or programmers. A wide variety of IT and cloud products and services claim to have machine learning or AI capabilities. These include firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDSs/IPSs), antivirus solutions, and so forth.</li>
<li><b>Blockchain:</b> Blockchain is an open means of conveying value using encryption techniques and algorithms. It is often referred to as “cryptocurrency.” It is basically a transactional ledger, where all participants can view every transaction, thus making it extremely difficult to negatively affect the integrity of past transactions. Blockchain can be perceived as a cloud technology because each record (“block”) is distributed among all the participants, regardless of location, type of device, jurisdiction, and so forth in a distributed, or cloud-based, manner.</li>
<li><b>Internet of Things (IoT):</b> It sometimes seems like every possible product now contains Internet connectivity: household appliances, cameras, toys, vehicles, and so on. This is collectively referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). The distributed nature of these devices (and their connection to and placement in networks) lends them some cloud characteristics. Perhaps the most salient security aspect of IoT is that devices without proper security can be subverted and used in attacks.</li>
<li><b>Containers:</b> This term refers to the logical segmentation of memory space in a device, creating two or more abstract areas that cannot interface directly. This is commonly seen in bring your own device (BYOD) environments where employees use their personal devices for work. The containers distinguish two distinct partitions—one for work functions/data and the other for personal functions/data. This gives the employer/data owner additional assurance that the data will not be accidentally or casually lost or stolen.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="19" id="Page_19"></span><b>Quantum computing:</b> This is an emerging technology that could allow IT systems to operate beyond binary math. Instead of using the presence of electrons for calculations (where the electrons exist in one of two states: either present or not present), quantum computing may use subatomic characteristics (electron spin, charm, and so on) to offer computation on an exponentially larger scale. This accelerates the machine’s ability to perform calculations/operations dramatically. Such systems are beginning to emerge beyond the theoretical stage, although none are yet commercially available at the time of this writing.</li>
<li><b>Homomorphic encryption:</b> Homomorphic encryption is a theoretical phenomenon that would allow processing of encrypted material without needing to first decrypt it. If achieved, this could allow cloud customers to upload encrypted data to the cloud and still utilize the data, without ever sharing the encryption keys with the cloud provider, or having to otherwise accomodate decryption as part of the process. This would make the use of cloud environments much more appealing to customers with highly valuable or sensitive data.</li>

<h2><a id="usec0032"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we have examined business requirements, cloud definitions, cloud computing roles and responsibilities, and foundational concepts of cloud computing.
