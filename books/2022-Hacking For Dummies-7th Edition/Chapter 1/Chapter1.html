These &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; break into &mdash; or crack &mdash; systems with malicious intent. They seek fame, intellectual property, profit, or even revenge.

(In case you&rsquo;re curious, the </span><span class="c0 c3">white hat</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c3">black hat</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;come from old Western TV shows in which the good guys wore white cowboy hats and the bad guys wore black cowboy hats.) </span><span class="c0 c3">Gray-hat</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;hackers are a bit of both.

Yeah, whatever. Malicious hackers are electronic miscreants and deserve the consequences of their actions.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Be careful not to confuse criminal hackers with security researchers. Researchers not only hack aboveboard and develop the amazing tools that we get to use in our work, but they also (usually) take responsible steps to disclose their findings and publish their code. Unfortunately, there is a war going on against legitimate information security research, and the tools and techniques are often questioned by government agencies. Some people are even forced to remove these tools from their websites.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.fwa4qp7ockfk"><span class="c4">Malicious user</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c3">A malicious user</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;&mdash; meaning a rogue employee, contractor, intern, or other user who abuses their trusted privileges &mdash; is a common term in security circles and in headlines about information breaches. The issue isn&rsquo;t necessarily users hacking internal systems but users who abuse the computer access privileges they&rsquo;ve been given. Users ferret through critical database systems to glean sensitive information, email confidential client information to the competition or elsewhere to the cloud to save for later, or delete sensitive files from servers that they probably didn&rsquo;t need to have access to in the first place.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Sometimes, an innocent (or ignorant) insider whose intent isn&rsquo;t malicious still causes security problems by moving, deleting, or corrupting sensitive information. Even an innocent fat finger on the keyboard can have dire consequences in the business world. Think about all the ransomware infections affecting businesses around the world. All it takes is one click by a careless user for your entire network to be affected.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Malicious users are often the worst enemies of IT and information security professionals because they know exactly where to go to get the goods and don&rsquo;t need to be computer-savvy to compromise sensitive information. These users have the access they need, and management trusts them &mdash; often without question.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.w4xl7tlckhm4"><span class="c5 c21">Recognizing How Malicious Attackers Beget Ethical Hackers</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">You need protection from hacker shenanigans. Along the lines of what my father taught me about being smarter than the machine you&rsquo;re working on, you have to become as savvy as the guys who are trying to attack your systems. A true IT or security professional possesses the skills, mindset, and tools of a hacker but is trustworthy. They perform hacks as security tests against systems based on how hackers think and work and make tireless efforts to protect the organizations&rsquo; network and information assets.</span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;Ethical hacking (otherwise known as vulnerability and penetration testing) involves the same tools, tricks, and techniques that criminal hackers use, with one major difference: It&rsquo;s performed with the target&rsquo;s permission in a professional setting. The intent of this testing is to discover vulnerabilities from a malicious attacker&rsquo;s viewpoint to better secure systems. Vulnerability and penetration testing is part of an overall information risk management program that allows for ongoing security improvements. This security testing can also ensure that vendors&rsquo; claims about the security of their products are legitimate.</span></p><h1 class="c26" id="h.7uqze6qq8jv4"><span class="c5 c24 c33">SECURITY TESTING CERTIFICATIONS</span></h1><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c0">If you perform vulnerability and penetration tests and want to add another certification to your credentials, you may want to consider becoming a Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH) through a certification program by EC-Council.

Security auditing involves comparing a company&rsquo;s security policies (or compliance requirements) with what&rsquo;s actually taking place. The intent of security auditing is to validate that security controls exist, typically by using a risk-based approach. Auditing often involves reviewing business processes, and in some cases, it isn&rsquo;t as technical. Some security audits, in fact, can be as basic as security checklists that simply serve to meet a specific compliance requirement.</span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;Not all audits are high-level, but many of the ones I&rsquo;ve seen &mdash; especially those involving compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) &mdash; are quite simplistic. Often, these audits are performed by people who have no technical security experience &mdash; or, worse, work outside IT altogether!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Conversely, security assessments based on ethical hacking focus on vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This testing approach validates that security controls </span><span class="c0 c3">don&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;exist or are ineffectual. This formal vulnerability and penetration testing can be both highly technical and nontechnical, and although it involves the use of formal methodology, it tends to be a bit less structured than formal auditing. Where auditing is required (such as for SSAE 18 SOC reports and the ISO 27001 certification) in your organization, you might consider integrating the vulnerability and penetration testing techniques I outline in this book into your IT/security audit program. You might actually be required to do so. Auditing and vulnerability and penetration testing complement one another really well.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.9nf5vtgwqsuo"><span class="c4">Policy considerations</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">If you choose to make vulnerability and penetration testing an important part of your business&rsquo;s information risk management program, you need to have a documented security testing policy. Such a policy outlines who&rsquo;s doing the testing, the general type of testing that&rsquo;s performed, and how often the testing takes place. Specific procedures for carrying out your security tests could outline the methodologies I cover in this book. You should also consider creating security standards documented along with your policy that outline the specific security testing tools used and the specific people performing the testing. You could establish standard testing dates, such as once per quarter for external systems and biannual tests for internal systems &mdash; whatever works for your business.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.pj23dba6klba"><span class="c4">Compliance and regulatory concerns</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Your own internal policies may dictate how management views security testing, but you also need to consider the state, federal, and international laws and regulations that affect your business. In particular, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) sends chills down the spines of legitimate researchers. See </span><span class="c18"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.eff.org/issues/dmca&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141520888322&amp;usg=AOvVaw1xKV4zC3Q07KhoprRb2TfP">www.eff.org/issues/dmca</a></span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;for everything that the DMCA has to offer.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Many federal laws and regulations in the United States &mdash; such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the associated Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) requirements, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) &mdash; require strong security controls and consistent security assessments. There&rsquo;s also the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC). CMMC is a follow-on to NIST Special Publication 800-171 Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations. This certification is intended to ensure that the U.S. Department of Defense&rsquo;s (DoD&rsquo;s) Defense Industrial Base (DIB) of suppliers/contractors are adequately protecting the DOD&rsquo;s information assets.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Related international laws &mdash;such as the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), the European Union&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Japan&rsquo;s Personal Information Protection Act (JPIPA) &mdash; are no different. Incorporating your security tests into these compliance requirements is a great way to meet state and federal regulations and to beef up your overall information security and privacy program.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.rtxmpebqtcbp"><span class="c21 c5">Understanding the Need to Hack Your Own Systems</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">To catch a thief, you must think like a thief. That adage is the basis of vulnerability and penetration testing. Knowing your enemy is critical. The law of averages works against security. With the increased number of hackers and their expanding knowledge and the growing number of system vulnerabilities and other unknowns, all computer systems and applications are likely to be hacked or compromised somehow. Protecting your systems from the bad guys &mdash;not just addressing general security best practices &mdash; is critical. When you know hacker tricks, you find out how vulnerable your systems really are and can take the necessary steps to make them secure.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Hacking preys on weak security practices and both disclosed and undisclosed vulnerabilities. More and more research, such as the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (</span><span class="c18"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141520889649&amp;usg=AOvVaw3mUtoI3A6ppVFY3la6BWZV">www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/</a></span><span class="c0">), shows that long-standing, </span><span class="c0 c3">known</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;vulnerabilities are continually being targeted. Firewalls, advanced endpoint security, security incident and event management (SIEM), and other fancy (and expensive) security technologies often create a false feeling of safety. Attacking your own systems to discover vulnerabilities &mdash; especially the low-hanging fruit that gets so many people into trouble &mdash; helps you go beyond security products to make them even more secure. Vulnerability and penetration testing is a proven method for greatly hardening your systems from attack. If you don&rsquo;t identify weaknesses, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the vulnerabilities are exploited.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">As hackers expand their knowledge, so should you. You must think like them and work like them to protect your systems from them. As a security professional, you must know the activities that the bad guys carry out, as well as how to stop their efforts. Knowing what to look for and how to use that information helps you thwart their efforts.</span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have to protect your systems from </span><span class="c0 c3">everything.</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t. The only protection against everything is unplugging your computer systems and locking them away so no one can touch them &mdash; not even you and especially not your users. But doing so is not the best approach to security, and it&rsquo;s certainly not good for business! What&rsquo;s important is protecting your systems from known vulnerabilities and common attacks &mdash; the 20 percent of the issues that create 80 percent of the risks, which happen to be some of the most overlooked weaknesses in most organizations. Seriously, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe the basic flaws I see in my work!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Anticipating all the possible vulnerabilities you&rsquo;ll have in your systems and business processes is impossible. You certainly can&rsquo;t plan for all types of attacks &mdash; especially the unknown ones.

This section discusses some well-known attacks but is by no means a comprehensive listing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Many security vulnerabilities aren&rsquo;t critical by themselves, but exploiting several vulnerabilities at the same time can take its toll on a system or network environment. A default Windows operating system (OS) configuration, a weak SQL Server administrator password, or a mission-critical workstation running on a wireless network may not be a major security concern by itself. But someone who exploits all three of these vulnerabilities simultaneously could enable unauthorized remote access and disclose sensitive information (among other things).</span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;Complexity is the enemy of security.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Vulnerabilities and attacks have grown enormously in recent years because of virtualization, cloud computing, and even social media. These three things alone add immeasurable complexity to your environment. On top of that, with the new ways of the world and so many people working from home, the complexities have grown exponentially.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.czycgj9b8kc2"><span class="c4">Nontechnical attacks</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Exploits that involve manipulating people &mdash; your users and even you &mdash; are often the greatest vulnerability. Humans are trusting by nature, which can lead to social engineering exploits. </span><span class="c0 c3">Social engineering</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is exploiting the trusting nature of human beings to gain information &mdash; often via email phishing &mdash; for malicious purposes.

Examples of network infrastructure attacks include the following:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_9w2979ufhmp-0 start"><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Connecting to a network through an unsecured wireless access point attached behind a firewall</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Exploiting weaknesses in network protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Flooding a network with too many requests, creating denial of service (DoS) for legitimate requests</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Installing a network analyzer on a network segment and capturing packets that travel across it, revealing confidential information in cleartext</span></li></ul><h3 class="c12" id="h.4ftdmblvj8ty"><span class="c4">Operating system attacks</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Hacking an OS is a preferred method of the bad guys. OS attacks make up a large portion of attacks simply because every computer has an operating system. They are susceptible to many well-known exploits, including vulnerabilities that remain unpatched years later.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Occasionally, some OSes that tend to be more secure out of the box &mdash; such as the old-but-still-out-there Novell NetWare, OpenBSD, and IBM Series i &mdash; are attacked, and vulnerabilities turn up.

Web applications and mobile apps, which are probably the most popular means of attack, are often beaten down. The following are examples of application attacks and related exploits that are often present on business networks:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_4lm8ycc2q5sk-0 start"><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Websites and applications are everywhere. Thanks to what&rsquo;s called </span><span class="c1">shadow IT,</span><span class="c6 c5">&nbsp;in which people in various areas of the business run and manage their own technology, website applications are in every corner of the internal network and out in the cloud. Unfortunately, many IT and security professionals are unaware of the presence of shadow IT and the risks it creates.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Mobile apps face increasing attacks, given their popularity in business settings. There are also rogue apps discovered on the app stores that can create challenges in your environment.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Unsecured files containing sensitive information are scattered across workstation and server shares as well as out into the cloud in places like Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive. Database systems also contain numerous vulnerabilities that malicious users can exploit.</span></li></ul><h2 class="c12" id="h.mhsot9v3csy4"><span class="c21 c5">Following the Security Assessment Principles</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Security professionals must carry out the same attacks against computer systems, physical controls, and people that malicious hackers do. (I introduce those attacks in the preceding section.) A security professional&rsquo;s intent, however, is to highlight any associated weaknesses. </span><span class="c25 c24"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hacking-for-dummies/9781119872191/p02.xhtml&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141520896866&amp;usg=AOvVaw01fERoHwQS70XgP_BpKD2b">Parts 2</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;through </span><span class="c25 c24"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hacking-for-dummies/9781119872191/p05.xhtml&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141520897232&amp;usg=AOvVaw3CprjM3FNzE-jFnXjDr5pz">5</a></span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;of this book cover how you might proceed with these attacks in detail, along with specific countermeasures you can implement against attacks on your business.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">To ensure that security testing is performed adequately and professionally, every security professional needs to follow a few basic tenets. The following sections introduce the important principles.</span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Warning" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t heed these principles, bad things could happen. I&rsquo;ve seen them ignored or forgotten by IT departments while planning and executing security tests. The results weren&rsquo;t positive; trust me.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.g42nzqw96agf"><span class="c4">Working ethically</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The word </span><span class="c0 c3">ethical</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;in this context means working with high professional morals and values. Whether you&rsquo;re performing security tests against your own systems or for someone who has hired you, everything you do must be aboveboard in support of the company&rsquo;s goals, with no hidden agenda &mdash; just professionalism. Being ethical also means reporting all your findings, whether or not they may create political backlash. Don&rsquo;t laugh; on numerous occasions, I&rsquo;ve witnessed people brushing off security vulnerability findings because they didn&rsquo;t want to rock the boat or to deal with difficult executives or vendors.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c3">Trustworthiness</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;is the ultimate tenet. It&rsquo;s also the best way to get (and keep) people on your side in support of your security program. Misusing information and power is forbidden; that&rsquo;s what the bad guys do, so let them be the ones who pay a fine or go to prison because of their poor choices.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.zdewdln4vewn"><span class="c4">Respecting privacy</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Treat the information you gather with respect. All information you obtain during your testing &mdash; from web application flaws to clear text email passwords to personally identifiable information (PII) and beyond &mdash; must be kept private. Nothing good can come of snooping into confidential corporate information or employees&rsquo; or customers&rsquo; private lives.</span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;Involve others in your process. Employ a peer review or similar oversight system that can help build trust and support for your security assessment projects.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.fgjlpyhptlhn"><span class="c4">Not crashing your systems</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">One of the biggest mistakes I&rsquo;ve seen people make when trying to test their own systems is inadvertently crashing the systems they&rsquo;re trying to keep running. Crashing systems doesn&rsquo;t happen as often as it used to given the resiliency of today&rsquo;s systems, but poor planning and timing can have negative consequences.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Although you&rsquo;re not likely to do so, you can create DoS conditions on your systems when testing. Running too many tests too quickly can cause system lockups, data corruption, reboots, and similar problems, especially when you&rsquo;re testing older servers and web applications. (I should know; I&rsquo;ve done it!) Don&rsquo;t assume that a network or specific host can handle the beating that network tools and vulnerability scanners can dish out.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">You can even accidentally create accounts or lock users out of the network without realizing the consequences. Proceed with caution and common sense. Either way, be it you or someone else, these weaknesses likely exist on your network, and it&rsquo;s better that you discover them first!</span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;Most vulnerability scanners can control how many requests are sent to each system simultaneously. These settings are especially handy when you need to run the tests on production systems during regular business hours. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to throttle back your scans. Completing your testing will take longer, but throttling back may save you a lot of grief if an unstable system is present.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.8ixahlc9lxyn"><span class="c21 c5">Using the Vulnerability and Penetration Testing Process</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">As with practically any IT or security project, you need to plan security testing. It&rsquo;s been said that action without planning is the root of every failure. Strategic and tactical issues in vulnerability and penetration testing need to be determined and agreed on in advance. To ensure the success of your efforts, spend time planning for any amount of testing, from a simple OS password-cracking test against a few servers to a penetration test of a complex web environment.</span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Warning" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If you choose to hire a &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; hacker to work with you during your testing or to obtain an independent perspective, be careful.

Make sure that what you&rsquo;re doing is known and visible &mdash; at least to the decision-makers. Obtaining sponsorship of the project is the first step. This is how your testing objectives are defined. Sponsorship could come from your manager, an executive, your client, or even yourself if you&rsquo;re the boss. You need someone to back you up and sign off on your plan. Otherwise, your testing may be called off unexpectedly if someone (including third parties such as cloud service and hosting providers) claims that you were never authorized to perform the tests. Worse, you could be fired or charged with criminal activity.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">The authorization can be as simple as an internal memo or an email from your boss when you perform these tests on your own systems. If you&rsquo;re testing for a client, have a signed contract stating the client&rsquo;s support and authorization. Get written approval of this sponsorship before you ever start working to ensure that none of your time or effort is wasted. This documentation is your &ldquo;Get Out of Jail Free&rdquo; card if anyone &mdash; such as your Internet service provider (ISP), cloud service provider, or a related vendor &mdash;questions what you&rsquo;re doing or if the authorities come calling. Don&rsquo;t laugh &mdash; it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time it has happened.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">One slip can crash your systems, which isn&rsquo;t necessarily what anyone wants. You need a detailed plan, but you don&rsquo;t need volumes of testing procedures that make the plan overly complex. A well-defined scope includes the following information:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_nmw2c75xu5f5-0 start"><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Specific systems to be tested:</span><span class="c6 c5">&nbsp;When selecting systems to test, start with the most critical systems and processes or the ones that you suspect are the most vulnerable. You could test server OS passwords, test an Internet-facing web application, or attempt social engineering via phishing before drilling down into all your systems. Another consideration is whether to test computer systems that are being used by employees who are working from home. Unless they are connected to the corporate environment over a VPN or are otherwise remotely accessible, you might not even be able to reach them. Furthermore, what are the ramifications of testing computers &mdash; especially personal systems &mdash; that are running on a home network? Are there medical devices, specific software, or Internet of Things systems that might be disrupted? Thinking all of this through with all the right people is imperative.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Risks involved:</span><span class="c6 c5">&nbsp;Have a contingency plan for your security testing process in case something goes awry. Suppose that you&rsquo;re assessing your firewall or a web application, and you take it down. This situation can cause system unavailability, which can reduce system performance or employee productivity. Worse, it might cause data integrity loss, loss of data itself, and even bad publicity. It&rsquo;ll most certainly tick off a person or two and make you look bad. All of these can create business risks.<br>Handle social engineering and DoS attacks carefully. Determine how they might affect the people and systems you test.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Dates when the tests will be performed and overall timeline:</span><span class="c6 c5">&nbsp;Determining when the tests are to be performed is something you must think long and hard about. Decide whether to perform tests during normal business hours, or late at night or early in the morning so that production systems aren&rsquo;t affected. Involve others to make sure that they approve of your timing.<br>You may get pushback and suffer DoS-related consequences, but the best approach is an unlimited attack, in which any type of test is possible at any time of day. The bad guys aren&rsquo;t breaking into your systems within a limited scope so why should you? Some exceptions to this approach are performing all-out DoS attacks, social engineering, and physical security tests.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Whether you intend to be detected:</span><span class="c6 c5">&nbsp;One of your goals may be to perform the tests without being detected. You might perform your tests on remote systems or on a remote office and don&rsquo;t want the users to be aware of what you&rsquo;re doing. Otherwise, the users or IT staff may catch on to you and be on their best behavior instead of their normal behavior.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Whether to leave security controls enabled:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;An important, yet often overlooked, issue is whether to leave enabled security controls such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPSes), and web application firewalls (WAFs) so that they block scans and exploit attempts. Leaving these controls enabled provides a real-world picture of where things stand. But I&rsquo;ve found </span><span class="c1">much</span><span class="c6 c5">&nbsp;more value in disabling these controls (in the form of whitelisting your source IP addresses) so that you can pull back the curtains and find the greatest number of vulnerabilities.<br>Many people want to leave their security controls enabled. After all, that approach can make them look better, because many security checks will likely be blocked. To me, this defense-in-depth approach is great, but it can create a serious false sense of security and doesn&rsquo;t paint the entire picture of an organization&rsquo;s overall security posture. There&rsquo;s no right or wrong answer. Just make sure that everyone is on board with what is being tested and what the final outcomes and report represent.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Knowledge of the systems before testing:</span><span class="c6 c5">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t need extensive knowledge of the systems you&rsquo;re testing &mdash; just basic understanding, which protects both you and the tested systems. Understanding the systems you&rsquo;re testing shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult if you&rsquo;re testing your own in-house systems. If you&rsquo;re testing a client&rsquo;s systems, you may have to dig deeper. Only one or two clients have asked me for a fully blind assessment.<br>Most IT managers and others who are responsible for security may be scared of blind assessments, which can take more time, cost more, and be less effective. Base the type of test you perform on the organization&rsquo;s or client&rsquo;s needs.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Actions to take when a major vulnerability is discovered:</span><span class="c6 c5">&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t stop after you find one or two security holes; keep going to see what else you can discover. I&rsquo;m not saying that you should keep testing until the end of time or until you crash all your systems; ain&rsquo;t nobody got time for that! Instead, simply pursue the path you&rsquo;re going down until you can&rsquo;t hack it any longer (pun intended). If you haven&rsquo;t found any vulnerabilities, you haven&rsquo;t looked hard enough. Vulnerabilities are there. If you uncover something big such as a weak password or SQL injection on an external system, you need to share that information with the key players (developers, database administrators, IT managers, and so on) as soon as possible to plug the hole before it&rsquo;s exploited.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">The specific deliverables:</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;Deliverables may include vulnerability scanner reports and your own distilled report outlining important vulnerabilities to address, along with recommendations and countermeasures to implement.</span></li></ul><h3 class="c12" id="h.x8hqvs7c3026"><span class="c4">Selecting tools</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">As in any project, if you don&rsquo;t have the right tools for your security testing, you&rsquo;ll have difficulty accomplishing the task effectively. Having said that, just because you use the right tools doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;ll discover all the right vulnerabilities. Experience counts.</span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;Know the limitations of your tools. Many vulnerability scanners and testing tools generate false positives and negatives (incorrectly identifying vulnerabilities). Others skip vulnerabilities. In certain situations, such as testing web applications, you have to run multiple vulnerability scanners to find all the vulnerabilities.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Many tools focus on specific tests, and no tool can test for everything. For the same reason that you wouldn&rsquo;t drive a nail with a screwdriver, don&rsquo;t use a port scanner to uncover specific network vulnerabilities or a wireless network analyzer to test a web application. You need a set of specific tools for the task. The more (and better) tools you have, the easier your security testing efforts will be.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Make sure that you&rsquo;re using tools like these for your tasks:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_tuea1o6mhe5w-0 start"><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">To crack passwords, you need cracking tools such as Ophcrack and Proactive Password Auditor.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">For an in-depth analysis of a web application, a web vulnerability scanner (such as Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner or Probely) is more appropriate than a network analyzer (such as Wireshark or OmniPeek).</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">The capabilities of many security and hacking tools are misunderstood. This misunderstanding has cast a negative light on otherwise excellent and legitimate tools; even government agencies around the world are talking about making them illegal. Part of this misunderstanding is due to the complexity of some of these security testing tools, but it&rsquo;s largely based in ignorance and the desire for control. Whichever tools you use, familiarize yourself with them before you start using them. That way, you&rsquo;re prepared to use the tools in the ways that they&rsquo;re intended to be used. Here are ways to do that:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_m4tyzwildx5c-0 start"><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Read the readme and/or online help files and FAQs (frequently asked questions).</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Study the user guides.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Use the tools in a lab or test environment.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Watch tutorial videos on YouTube (if you can bear the poor production of most of them).</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Consider formal classroom training from the security-tool vendor or another third-party training provider, if available.</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Look for these characteristics in tools for security testing:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_kjveyubh8kmf-0 start"><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Adequate documentation</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Detailed reports on discovered vulnerabilities, including how they might be exploited and fixed</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">General industry acceptance</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">Availability of updates and responsiveness of technical support.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c5">High-level reports that can be presented to managers or nontechnical types (especially important in today&rsquo;s audit- and compliance-driven world)</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">These features can save you a ton of time and effort when you&rsquo;re performing your tests and writing your final reports.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.iqe4zw478and"><span class="c4">Executing the plan</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Good security testing takes persistence. Time and patience are important. Also, be careful when you&rsquo;re performing your tests. A criminal on your network or a seemingly benign employee looking over your shoulder may watch what&rsquo;s going on and use this information against you or your business.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0 c5">Making sure that no hackers are on your systems before you start isn&rsquo;t practical. Just be sure to keep everything as quiet and private as possible, especially when you&rsquo;re transmitting and storing test results.
