The global, decentralized nature of cloud computing presents numerous issues that we are just now grappling with in our endeavors to protect privacy rights, meet compliance demands, and maintain a secure computing environment.</p>
<p>This chapter will cover effective risk management, risk metrics, and strategies for an effective risk management program. I will round it out with a discussion of outsourcing, contract management, and the all-important service-level agreement (SLA).</p></section>

<h2><a id="usec0002"></a>The Impact of Diverse Geographical Locations and Legal Jurisdictions</h2>
<p>As discussed in <a href="Chapter 10 Legal and Compliance Part 1 _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html">Chapter 10</a>, “Legal and Compliance Part 1,” the impact of the decentralized, geographically, and geopolitically dispersed model of cloud computing presents numerous challenges, including these:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0016">
<li>Data processing, storage, and computing, each occurring in different geopolitical realms</li>
<li>Difficulties in assessing data actors</li>
<li>Difficulties in locating data</li>
</ul>
<p>A great deal of the difficulty in managing the legal ramifications of cloud computing stems from the design of cloud assets. They are necessarily dispersed, often across municipal, state, and even international borders. Resources are constantly being allocated and reallocated on a moment-to-moment basis. Also, specific control and administration of particular assets can be hard to ascertain and establish.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c11-feafxd-0001">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> Some jurisdictions, such as the EU, have rules about the “transparency” of Internet service providers (ISPs), whereby ISPs must refrain from giving preferential pricing or access to any particular customer online or must publicly publish an explanation/specification when they do. So if your organization negotiates a particularly beneficial pricing/service package with a cloud provider that also happens to be an ISP in the EU, the details of this pricing/service might be required, by law, to become public record. You can find the EU law here: <a class="codeLabel" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120&amp;rid=2">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120&amp;rid=2</a>.</p>
</section>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="272" id="Page_272"></span>It is that transborder aspect that is most troublesome, in terms of allowing the cloud customer to maintain compliance with legal and regulatory mandates. As we discussed in the previous chapter, each jurisdiction can have its own governance, which can vary wildly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and jurisdictions can overlap. A city is in a county or other municipality, the latter of which is in a state, which is in a country, and they might all have conflicting guidance and interests. Moreover, legislation and guidance is always in flux, especially in our industry. Lawmakers and standards bodies are constantly trying to catch up to the requirements and questions posed by new technologies and how those technologies are used. And these vagaries of law affect not only the cloud customer, in terms of how the customer must behave and respond to legal action, but also how the cloud provider must perform in response to these same stimuli.</p>
<p>The governance used by both entities—the cloud customer and the cloud provider—must take all of this into account in order to operate reasonably with acknowledgment of legal risks and liabilities in the cloud.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c11-feafxd-0002">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> It is important to not confuse the concepts of “governance” and “corporate governance.” Governance refers to the legal and regulatory mandates of regions and countries. Corporate governance is the relationship between shareholders and other stakeholders in the organization versus the senior management of the corporation.</p>
</section>
<section id="c11-sec-0003">
<h3><a id="usec0003"></a>Policies</h3>
<p>Policies are one of the foundational elements of a governance and risk management program. They guide the organization, based on standards and guidelines. Policies ensure that the organization is operating within its risk profile. Policies actually define, or are the expression of, the organization’s risk tolerance.</p>
<p>Before the organization begins creating its policies, it starts by identifying the stakeholders. This ensures that the right individuals are involved in creating the expression of risk tolerance. These can include the following:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0017">
<li>Business unit leaders</li>
<li>The board of directors</li>
<li>Investors</li>
<li>Regulators</li>
</ul>
<p>The views, perceptions, and choices of these groups will influence the organization’s willingness and ability to accept risk, but most of these stakeholders will not be directly involved in crafting organizational policy. For instance, the regulators won’t (or shouldn’t) help draft policy, but they enforce the regulations that establish what risks an organization takes and how it takes them. The regulators, ostensibly acting on behalf of lawmakers and in turn working on behalf of the public (because they chose those lawmakers), are expressing the view of the public, vis-à-vis risk, on organizations.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="273" id="Page_273"></span>For example, say an organization offered a new product, but the risk of creating that product might result in an employee dying once per month. The organization might be willing to take on that risk if the potential profits were high enough, and the employees might be willing to take on that risk if the pay was high enough. However, regulators might take a dim view of offering such a product at the possible cost of human life, so the risk appetite of the organization would necessarily be limited by regulation.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c11-feafxd-0003">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> The decision to risk human life is not necessarily unethical or immoral. Deep sea fishing has been one of the most fatal professions in the United States for more than one hundred years, and consumers have not stopped buying seafood en masse out of protest and loathing at the potential human cost of acquiring their meals. People engaged in commercial fishing choose to risk their lives to make very good money and seem to enjoy their work, regulators mandate reasonable safety requirements for the industry, and consumers enjoy seafood.</p>
</section>
<p>Once the stakeholder inputs have been adequately identified, the organization can begin building the policies needed in order to operate safely.</p>
<p>Identifying and engaging relevant stakeholders is vital to the success of any cloud computing discussions or projects. But there are also challenges that may need to be overcome in order to effectively engage them.</p>
<p>For instance, policies must be malleable enough to reflect changing business opportunities, requirements, and operations. This may have never been truer than in the example of an organization migrating from a legacy environment to the cloud. Almost assuredly, the organization had policies in place that acknowledged the risks and opportunities of that environment (the legacy, traditional IT environment) and dealt with them accordingly. However, the risks and benefits in the cloud are much different, so the policies must be revisited; the guidance and stakeholder input reexamined; and new policies generated, amended, or appended to the old policies.</p>
<p>The variety and vagaries of multijurisdictional law make the regulatory stakeholders and their input especially complicated for cloud services and management. Instead of one regulatory framework to consider when drafting policy, the organization now must take into account every jurisdiction where the cloud provider might be storing, transmitting, and processing the organization’s data as well as every jurisdiction where any of the organization’s end customers might reside. This latter part is especially troublesome, because when an organization operates in the cloud, it is assumed that the potential customer base is the web, meaning that the jurisdiction of the organization’s customer is the entire planet.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to craft pertinent policy that met the needs and requirements of every jurisdiction in the world. Too many of them inherently conflict with others. So a significant portion of the effort that goes into promulgating policy is determining which jurisdictional mandates are most likely to bear on the organization’s operations, where most of the end clientele will reside, where most of the cloud functions will take place, and so forth. It’s a cost-benefit analysis of a lesser scale: instead of determining whether the organization <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="274" id="Page_274"></span>has the risk appetite to perform a given function, this part of the effort will be used to determine which laws and regulators will be most likely to impact the organization and which ones should therefore have the most bearing on the organization’s policy.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that while subject matter experts (such as the CCSP) will be called on to draft policies related to the organization’s operations in the cloud, general counsel will provide an invaluable input when creating all the organization’s policies. Attorneys will be the personnel most versed in identifying, understanding, and tailoring documentation to address the multitude of jurisdictional regulation the organization might face.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, subject matter experts will be called on to create particular policies for the organization. These experts might be internal employees and staff of the organization. They might be external consultants hired for the purpose. The policies might be purchased from an existing set that were designed and drafted by experts in that particular area of expertise and then tailored by the organization to meet its own needs. In this regard, the CCSP should expect to be called on to offer input and advice when the organization is formalizing cloud policy.</p>
<p>After the experts have drafted the policy, the policy must be presented to the decision makers: senior management and the board of directors. The subject matter experts may be called on to explain specific aspects of the policy, expound on particular threats and tangible benefits, and explain how these risks are being addressed by the policy. Senior management must understand these draft policies in order to make an informed decision in accepting them (and the risks and benefits they entail) or modifying the policies as they see fit. Ultimately, policy acceptance will involve a senior manager signing the policy document and the board (or other governance body) acknowledging their approval of the policy.</p>
<p>Once the policy has been formally accepted, it must be published and disseminated among those affected by it. Communication in an enterprise environment is challenging in and of itself. Cloud computing makes this communication even more complicated because the IT administration staff may not be local, there might be time zone differences between the provider and customer, and providers could have literally thousands of other customers.</p>
<p>Communication to other business units or departments is vitally important as well. All of the internal and external stakeholders should be kept abreast of any changes or other issues related to policies and operations. Here are some common departments that include internal stakeholders:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0018">
<li>IT</li>
<li>HR</li>
<li>Vendor management</li>
<li>Compliance</li>
<li>Risk management</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Operations</li>
</ul>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="275" id="Page_275"></span>Some things that complicate communication are listed here:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0019">
<li>Disparate administrative workforce</li>
<li>Time zone differences</li>
<li>Ignorance of cloud computing models and concepts</li>
<li>Poor understanding of business drivers</li>
<li>Poor understanding of the organization’s risk appetite</li>
</ul>
<p>When discussing these matters with stakeholders, remember that in all likelihood they will not have a grasp of the cloud computing concepts held by the CCSP. Therefore, it is in everyone’s best interest to take things slowly and to ensure that questions get answered adequately so that everyone is on the same page. It is also the CCSP’s job to educate stakeholders about cloud computing risks and benefits so that they are better able to make fact-based decisions as opposed to relying on hearsay and gossip.</p>
<p>Some of the policy elements that the organization will need to appropriately reflect the cloud computing paradigm are as follows:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0020">
<li>Information security policy (ISP)</li>
<li>Acceptable use policy</li>
<li>Data classification policy</li>
<li>Network and Internet security</li>
<li>Passwords</li>
<li>Anti-malware policy</li>
<li>Software security</li>
<li>Disaster recovery and data backup</li>
<li>Remote and third-party access</li>
<li>Segregation of duties</li>
<li>Incident response plan</li>
<li>Personnel security</li>
<li>Identity and access management (IAM) policy</li>
<li>Legal compliance</li>
<li>Encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be times when a cloud provider is unable to meet an organization’s internal policy requirements. When that occurs, it is imperative that these deficiencies be taken into account and managed as part of any internal governance process (or this may be the time to find an alternative cloud provider whose service does meet the organization’s requirements). This will ensure that any contract elements or SLAs will not violate the organizational policies or place the organization at undue risk outside its tolerance levels.</p></section>

<h3><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="276" id="Page_276"></span><a id="usec0004"></a>Implications of the Cloud for Enterprise Risk Management</h3>
<p>Cloud computing as it exists today has commoditized compute, storage, and networking services. Enterprise risk management has shifted in response to this change. It is vitally important that both the customer and the provider focus on risk management and the challenges presented with cloud computing. The cloud customer (in the role of data owner) is ultimately responsible for ensuring control effectiveness, but stored data, security, and risk management require a partnership between the customer and provider. Before you explore the detailed discussion of risk management, you need to be familiar with some risk-related terms.</p>
<p><b>Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) </b>Key risk indicators are metrics used by an organization to inform management if there is impending negative impact to operations. KRIs typically involve algorithms and ratings systems ascribed to factors selected by analysts and management in order to create an early-warning system for increased risk to the organization.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c11-feafxd-0004">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> KRIs are forward-looking; by contrast key performance indicators (KPIs) help an organization understand risks or events that have already occurred and impacted the business.</p>
</section>
<p><b>Risk Appetite/Tolerance </b>Risk tolerance and appetite are similar descriptors of how the organization views risk. Senior management dictates the amount of risk an organization is willing to take, generally based on the amount of perceived benefit related to the risk. Regulators and other external factors (such as contracts) may affect the organization’s risk appetite as well.</p>
<p><b>Risk Profiles </b>The risk profile of the organization is a comprehensive analysis of the possible risks to the organization. The risk profile should include a survey of the various operations the organization is engaged in, public perception of the organization, pending legislation that might affect the organization, the stability of countries where the organization operates, and so forth.</p></section>
<section id="c11-sec-0005">
<h3><a id="usec0005"></a>Choices Involved in Managing Risk</h3>
<p>An organization always has four choices when faced with risk:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0021">
<li>Risk avoidance</li>
<li>Risk acceptance</li>
<li>Risk transference</li>
<li>Risk mitigation</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections will explore each of these options further.</p><section id="c11-sec-0006">
<h4><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="277" id="Page_277"></span><a id="usec0006"></a>Risk Avoidance</h4>
<p>Risk avoidance is not a method for handling risk but a response to the cost-benefit analysis when posed with a specific risk. If an organization is faced with a risk where the potential costs far outweigh the likely benefits, the organization may choose not to engage in the activity that would incur the risk <i>at all</i>. This is the only surefire method for eliminating a specific risk: don’t conduct the risky activity.</p>
<p>For instance, if the activity is, say, taking a package across the ocean, and the risk includes such potential costs as drowning, soaking the package in seawater and rendering it worthless, losing both the package and the ship, and so on, and the potential benefit is being paid $5 to transport the package, the organization might (rightly) deem the risk not to be worth the reward and choose instead to stay out of the transoceanic delivery business. The organization can then be said to have engaged in risk avoidance.</p></section>
<section id="c11-sec-0007">
<h4><a id="usec0007"></a>Risk Acceptance</h4>
<p>The direct opposite of risk avoidance is risk acceptance. In examining the potential benefits and risks of a certain activity, if the organization determines that the risks are minimal and the reward is substantial, the organization might choose to accept the risks involved in the endeavor and press on with the activity without any additional consideration.</p>
<p>To use the prior example, if the organization determines that the risks of transporting a package across the ocean are so low as to be negligible (say, if there is a sufficient historical record to indicate that nobody has drowned or lost a ship or package on similar journeys in the past 10 years) and the reward is significant (if the organization is offered $5,000 instead of $5), then the organization make take the job of moving the package without any other consideration. This is risk acceptance.</p>
<p>To use some of the concepts of the prior discussion in this chapter, if the risk of the activity is estimated to be within the organization’s <i>risk appetite</i>, then the organization might choose risk acceptance.</p></section>
<section id="c11-sec-0008">
<h4><a id="usec0008"></a>Risk Transference</h4>
<p>Risk transference is a way to handle risk associated with an activity without accepting <i>all</i> the risk. With risk transference, the organization finds someone else to incur the potential risk of an endeavor at a fraction of the potential cost the organization would incur if the risk was realized.</p>
<p>Basically, when you think of risk transference, think one word: <i>insurance</i>. The organization is going to pay a portion of what the worst outcome would be in order to insulate against the cost of that worst outcome.</p>
<p>Now return to the example from the previous sections: If the organization can buy shipping insurance for the task of delivering the package, then the worst-case scenario (someone drowning, losing the ship, or losing the package, and therefore losing the payment for transporting it) can be offset by a proportional payout from the underwriter. Let’s say the organization gets paid $5,000 to ship the package and then buys an insurance policy for $500. The terms of the insurance policy state that failure to deliver the package results in a <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="278" id="Page_278"></span>payout significant enough to mollify the client (the sender of the package) as well as recoup the costs the organization faces in performance (the expenses incurred in performing the activity, such as renting a boat, hiring someone to carry the package, and so on). There might even be an extraordinary payout in the event of an extraordinary risk being realized (the boat is attacked by sharks and everyone on board is eaten along with the package). The reduced profit (reflecting the payment for shipping minus cost of the policy, which is $4,500 instead of the full $5,000) might still be acceptable to the organization because senior management is assured that the risks are being addressed.</p></section>
<section id="c11-sec-0009">
<h4><a id="usec0009"></a>Risk Mitigation</h4>
<p>The final option in managing risk is risk mitigation, and this is the option that comprises the daily workload of most security practitioners. Risk mitigation is the practice of reducing risk to an acceptable level through the use of controls and countermeasures. That is to say that the organization implements controls in order to bring known risks to within that organization’s risk appetite.</p>
<p>Using the same example as in the previous sections, controls that might be implemented to reduce the risk involved with shipping a package across the sea might include putting the package in a watertight container, affixing a tracking device to the package, equipping the ship conveying the package with anticollision sensors, and so on. When the organization has determined that the significant risks have been attenuated sufficiently with the proper controls, then the organization may decide that the business activity—shipping the package—has a sufficient chance of success.</p>
<p>There are two important things to note about risk mitigation:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0022">
<li>It is impossible to remove risk. Never believe anyone who says that something has “zero risk” or that a control offers “100 percent security.” Even with all possible controls placed on a business function, there will still remain some level of risk; we call this <i>residual risk</i>. If the residual risk that remains <i>after</i> controls have been implemented falls within the organization’s risk appetite, then the organization might choose to perform that function (that is, accept the risk). If the remaining residual risk exceeds the risk appetite of the organization, the controls are insufficient or the business is just too risky to perform.</li>
<li>The cost of the controls must be less than the potential benefit of the business process or the process is not profitable or worthwhile. You should never put a $10 lock on a $5 bicycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The organization should consider using differing types of controls when choosing to mitigate risk. In the security field, we usually group controls into three general types: physical, technical, and administrative.</p>
<p>Physical controls are controls that limit physical access to assets or that operate in a manner that reduces the impact of a physical event. Examples of physical controls include locks on doors, fire suppression equipment in data centers, fences, and guards.</p>
<p>Technical controls, also referred to as logical controls, are those controls that enhance some facets of the CIA triad, usually operating within a system, often in electronic fashion. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="279" id="Page_279"></span>Possible technical controls include encryption mechanisms, access control lists to limit user permissions, and audit trails and logs of system activity.</p>
<p>Administrative controls are those processes and activities (necessarily not physical or technical) that provide some aspect of security. Examples are personnel background checks, scheduled routine log reviews, mandatory vacations, robust and comprehensive security policies and procedures, and designing business processes so that there are no single points of failure and so that proper separation of duties exists.</p>
<p>Combining the types of controls is a good way to provide the organization with some defense in depth (also known as a layered defense); that is, require any malicious actor to overcome not just multiple controls but multiple <i>kinds</i> of controls so that more than one skillset would be necessary to access or acquire protected assets. Think of it this way: If we only used locks to protect material and we put locks on external entrances, on internal doors, and on a safe containing sensitive assets, then an intruder would still need only one skillset (lock picking) to acquire that material. Instead, if we combined the use of locks with guard patrols, intrusion sensors, and encryption, then someone who wanted unauthorized access or ownership of sensitive material would not only have to know lock picking, they would have to use subterfuge and stealth as well as decryption to get those assets.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c11-feafxd-0005">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> There is no reason you can’t combine some of the various risk management methods, and it’s actually a good practice to do so. For instance, an organization can implement risk controls to perform risk mitigation <i>and</i> buy insurance to transfer risk <i>and then</i> will still have to do risk acceptance when allowing for the residual risk. The only risk management option that can’t be combined with the others is risk avoidance, because avoiding the risk means not engaging in that business function, so there is nothing left to mitigate, transfer, or accept.</p>

<h4><a id="usec0012"></a>NIST SP 800-37 (Guide for Implementing the Risk Management Framework)</h4>
<p>NIST SP 800-37 is the Guide for Implementing the Risk Management Framework (RMF). This particular framework is a methodology for handling all organizational risk in a holistic, comprehensive, and continual manner. This RMF supersedes the old “Certification and Accreditation” model of cyclical inspections that have a specific duration (used widely in American military, intelligence, and federal government communities). This RMF relies heavily on the use of automated solutions, risk analysis and assessment, and implementing controls based on those assessments, with continuous monitoring and improvement.</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-37 is a guide organizations can use to implement the RMF. Although NIST standards are developed for use by the federal government, they have begun to be accepted in many non-government organizations as best practices. For instance, companies in the United States may use the NIST model and publications in developing not only their information security program, but also their risk management program and practices. NIST publications and standards have the dual benefit of being widely acknowledged as expert and sensible but also free of charge (all NIST documents are in the public domain). It takes little effort to adopt and adapt the NIST materials from their intended use in the federal space into use in a private sector or nonprofit endeavor.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these documents are not as accepted in international markets as are ISO/IEC standards. Therefore, if you conduct business outside the United States, you may want to investigate the other standards in more detail. Some overseas companies will not even do business with US companies unless they subscribe to and are certified under ISO standards.</p>

<h4><a id="usec0013"></a>European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA)</h4>
<p>You could think of European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) as a European counterpart to NIST. It is a standard and model developed in Europe. While it could be considered international because it is accepted throughout Europe, it is not as globally accepted in the way ISO standards are.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="281" id="Page_281"></span>ENISA is responsible for producing <i>Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks, and Recommendations for Information Security.</i> This guideline identifies 35 types of risks organizations should consider but goes further by identifying the top eight security risks based on likelihood and impact:</p>

<h3><a id="usec0014"></a>Risk Management Metrics</h3>
<p>To understand whether control mechanisms and policies are effective, it is important to identify risk management metrics that will reflect the effectiveness of your program. To do this, you can use what is referred to as a risk scorecard. These cards help you derive some relative value for risk of the activities in which you are engaged. They might, for instance, look something like this:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0025">
<li>5.	Critical</li>
<li>4.	High</li>
<li>3.	Moderate</li>
<li>2.	Low</li>
<li>1.	Minimal</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these levels would need to be defined so that risks could be adequately described. For instance, something that is critical (5) might cause irrevocable reputational and financial damage, whereas something that is moderate (3) might only cause some recoverable reputational and financial damage. Some companies even quantify these so there are actual dollar amounts attached to each. For example:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0026">
<li>Critical =&gt; $100,000 in damages</li>
<li>High =&gt; $50,000 but &lt; $100,000</li>
</ul></section>
<section id="c11-sec-0015">
<h3><a id="usec0015"></a>Contracts and Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)</h3>
<p>The most important documents establishing, defining, and enforcing the relationship between the cloud provider and cloud customer are the contract and the service-level <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="282" id="Page_282"></span>agreement (SLA). The contract describes in detail exactly what both parties’ responsibilities are; what services are being contracted; and what provisions are in place for the safety, security, integrity, and availability of those same services. The SLA is the list of defined, specific, numerical metrics that will be used to determine whether the provider is sufficiently meeting the contract terms during each period of performance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important relationship between the two documents is that the contract stipulates the penalty imposed on the cloud provider if any metric of the SLA is not met during a certain performance period. For instance, if the period of performance is one month and the SLA contains a metric that states, “Downtime will not exceed five (5) seconds per calendar month,” and the cloud provider has six seconds of downtime in December, then the contract should allow the cloud customer to withhold payment for the cost that would otherwise be paid for that month, without any interruption of the continued service that is scheduled for January. This is a penalty imposed on the provider for failing to meet the needs of the customer, a sort of guarantee built into the contract and enforced on a periodic basis.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by examining some of the essential components and activities that might be expressed in the contract between a provider and customer:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0027">
<li>Availability</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Security and privacy of data</li>
<li>Logging and reporting</li>
<li>Data location</li>
<li>Data format and structure</li>
<li>Portability</li>
<li>Identification and problem resolution</li>
<li>Change management</li>
<li>Dispute mediation</li>
<li>Exit strategy options</li>
<li>Components activity</li>
<li>Uptime guarantees (the five 9s principle, i.e., 99.999% uptime)</li>
<li>Penalties (for both consumer and provider)</li>
<li>Penalty exclusions (instances where penalties are not invoked)</li>
<li>Suspension of service</li>
<li>Provider liability</li>
<li>Data protection requirements</li>
<li>Disaster recovery</li>
<li>Security recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="283" id="Page_283"></span>As you can see, this assortment of details about services can be quite comprehensive. And if the CCSP or the cloud customer does not complete their due diligence by carefully scrutinizing the details of the contract, both parties could be dissatisfied with the eventual relationship. There are many considerations for what should be in the contract, depending on the needs of the organization.</p>
<p>The SLA, on the other hand, will assign specific numerical values to the performance objectives outlined in the contract. Using a sampling from the list of possible contract elements, the related SLA might include details like this:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0028">
<li>The cloud customer will have full, constant access to the customer’s accounts and data at all times, with an allowed exception of service interruption no greater than 24 hours per calendar quarter (where service interruption is the fault of the provider).</li>
<li>Data moved to or from the provider’s resources and control at the defined price will not exceed 40 gigabytes per hour; data movement exceeding this rate will incur additional costs as defined in the standard rate sheet included in the contract.</li>
<li>Customer service inquiries from the customer to the provider will be addressed via direct email or telephone contact within three hours of transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>While both the contract and the SLA may contain numerical values, the SLA will expressly include numerical metrics used to determine that recurring performance goals are met.</p>
<p>It’s very important that the customer consider all possible situations and risks associated with the customer’s business requirements when crafting and negotiating the contract and SLA. Suppose the provider promises availability that amounts to no more than 24 hours of downtime in any given quarter. But what if the customer is an online retailer who does 30 percent of their annual business the day after Thanksgiving and that is the 24-hour period of an outage? It could devastate the customer’s business and yet still meet the terms of the SLA.</p>
<p>It is also important to look at the quality of the items delivered as part of your SLA. For instance, being connected and available is one thing, but if the servers at the other end are sluggish, customer experience may lag. If bandwidth is sluggish or there is jitter, again, consumer experience suffers. So in your SLA you must also adequately address these quality of service (QoS) issues. Here are some more examples:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0029">
<li>Availability</li>
<li>Outage duration</li>
<li>Capacity metrics</li>
<li>Performance metrics</li>
<li>Storage device metrics</li>
<li>Server capacity metrics</li>
<li>Instance startup time metric</li>
<li>Response time metric</li>
<li>Completion time metric</li>
<li>Mean time to switchover</li>
<li>Storage capability</li>
<li>Server scalability</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="usec0016"></a>Business Requirements</h2>
<p>Before entering into any type of contract for cloud computing services, the organization should evaluate a number of things. First, there should be some compelling reason for engaging the cloud provider. Decisions should be made that assist the business in reaching its long-term goals. Decisions should never be made because they seem attractive or based on what your competitors are doing. You should have sound business reasons for deciding to use a cloud provider and for determining which one to choose.</p>
<p>As part of the due diligence in looking at cloud computing as a viable solution for the business, a few more items should be examined. Perhaps not all business units need to be involved in decision-making. Perhaps some changes will have little or no impact on them, in which case they do not need to be involved. This is called <i>scoping</i>, which is used to refer to including only departments or business units impacted by any cloud engagement.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of evaluating cloud computing solution is that of regulatory compliance. It is vital that you investigate what regulators’ expectations are with regard to cloud computing solutions and the additional or differing risks that engaging in the cloud solution will bring to the organization.</p>
<p>Lastly, you must look closely at the costs associated with any types of disaster recovery or outage situations and what you are able to withstand. Measurements such as recovery time objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), and maximum allowable downtime (MAD) are critical in making decisions about choosing cloud computing solutions. You must be able to withstand certain amounts of outages based on your risk profile as they are bound to occur at some time. Knowing how to handle them and how your cloud provider will handle them is imperative.</p></section>
<section id="c11-sec-0017">
<h2><a id="usec0017"></a>Cloud Contract Design and Management for Outsourcing</h2>
<p>It is important that appropriate governance be involved in contract design and management of outsourcing. An in-depth understanding of contracts and contract management is important and is often managed by a specific department in large organizations. It is the CCSP’s responsibility to ensure that contract managers understand the details of what they are managing so that the organization does not incur undue risk.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="285" id="Page_285"></span>One example of adequate governance is how often contracts are renewed. This can and should be on at least an annual basis (if not sooner, if there are problems). Contracts should also specify how conflicts will be resolved.</p>
<p>Two other vitally important aspects of contracts have to do with the notion of data portability and vendor lock-in. <i>Vendor lock-in</i> is getting stuck with a certain provider, generally either as a result of detrimental contract terms or technical limitations. Data portability is the trait customers seek in order to avoid lock-in. <i>Data portability</i> is the term used to describe the ease of moving data from one cloud provider to another (or away from the cloud provider and back to a legacy enterprise environment). The greater the portability of the data, the less chance of vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>If you choose to stop doing business with your cloud vendor, what happens to your data? Is it transportable? Can you move it to another provider? Will the data be in some type of universal format so it is usable? Will you have a reasonable amount of time to move your data should conflicts go unresolved? And what will happen to your data once you leave the provider? Have you or they made arrangements for adequate data deletion using such techniques as crypto-shredding? These questions are all important things to consider when managing outsourcing contracts.</p></section>

<h2><a id="usec0018"></a>Identifying Appropriate Supply Chain and Vendor Management Processes</h2>
<p>When discussing supply chain and vendor management in the realm of cloud computing, we are talking about operational aspects that entail risk. For instance, availability could be affected by the entirety of the cloud supply chain:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0030">
<li>Cloud carriers (the ISPs between the cloud customer and the cloud provider)</li>
<li>Platform providers (the vendors supplying the operating systems used in the cloud service)</li>
<li>Application providers (the vendors supplying the software used in the cloud service)</li>
</ul>
<p>These can all be different entities making up the supply chain. Should any one of these become unavailable for some reason or cause problems in accessing resources, the customer faces an outage as well. These are risks associated with supply chain management and must be handled accordingly.</p>
<p>To adequately understand your risk exposure, you must first and foremost understand your SLAs and your provider’s abilities to meet the SLA metrics.</p><section id="c11-sec-0019">
<h3><a id="usec0019"></a>Common Criteria Assurance Framework (ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009)</h3>
<p>Common Criteria Assurance Framework (ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009) is yet another international standard designed to provide assurances for security claims by vendors. It establishes a universal format for evaluating security functions included in IT products.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="286" id="Page_286"></span>The primary goal is to provide customers with assurance that security products they purchase have been thoroughly tested by independent third-party testers and meet the requirements the customer has specified.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the Common Criteria certification of the product only verifies that the vendor’s claims regarding security functionality are true, <i>not</i> whether those security functions are appropriate, meet industry best practices, or will be sufficient for a specific user’s/customer’s business needs or regulatory compliance. It is also important to note that the configuration of any product must match what was tested for the certification, otherwise the product may not meet the security needs of the organization.</p>

<h3><a id="usec0020"></a>CSA Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR)</h3>
<p>The CSA STAR program, initiated in 2011, was created in response to market demand for a single consistent framework for evaluating cloud providers. The CSA STAR program was designed to provide an independent level of program assurance for cloud consumers. It is based on three levels of assurance, covers four offerings, and consists of a comprehensive set of cloud-centric control objectives.</p>
<p>The CSA STAR is a registry of security controls provided by popular cloud computing offerings and is designed for users to assess cloud providers, security providers, and advisory and assessment service firms as part of their vendor management due diligence in choosing providers.</p>
<p>The CSA STAR consists of the two following components:</p>
<p><b>Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) </b>A list of security controls and principles appropriate for the cloud environment, cross-referenced to other control frameworks such as COBIT, ISO standards, and NIST pubs. You can download a copy of the current CCM from CSA at <a class="codeLabel" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/csa-ccm-v-3-0-1-11-12-2018-FINAL/">https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/csa-ccm-v-3-0-1-11-12-2018-FINAL/</a>.</p>
<p><b>Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ) </b>A self-assessment performed by cloud providers, detailing their evaluation of the practice areas and control groups they use in providing their services. You can request a copy of the current CAIQ from CSA at <a class="codeLabel" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/consensus-assessments-initiative-questionnaire-v3-0-1/">https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/ consensus-assessments-initiative-questionnaire-v3-0-1/</a>. You can also review completed CAIQs and certifications for various cloud providers in the CSA’s STAR registry online at <a class="codeLabel" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/#_registry">https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/#_registry</a>.</p>
<p>The CSA STAR program also consists of three levels based on the Open Certification Framework:</p>
<p><b>Level One: Self-Assessment </b>Requires the release and publication of due diligence assessments against the CSA’s <i>Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire and/or Cloud Matrix (CCM)</i></p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="287" id="Page_287"></span><b>Level Two: CSA STAR Attestation </b>Requires the release and publication of available results of an assessment carried out by an independent third party based on CSA CCM and ISO 27001:2013 or an AICPA SOC 2</p>
<p><b>Level Three: CSA STAR Continuous Monitoring </b>Requires the release and publication of results of continuous monitoring performed by a certified third party</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c11-feafxd-0007">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> There have been several iterations of the CCM, with the most recent and default being CCM v3.0.1, with updates effective November 2018.</p>

<p>Much like the SOC reports discussed in <a href="Chapter 10 Legal and Compliance Part 1 _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html">Chapter 10</a>, these levels are representative of varying degrees of compliance with the framework. Involving independent third-party assessors can be quite expensive, and only large providers can usually absorb the cost as they typically also have a large investment in their security infrastructure.</p>

<h3><a id="usec0021"></a>Supply Chain Risk</h3>
<p>When evaluating supply chain risk, the customer should be thinking of disaster recovery and business continuity: What happens if something goes wrong with one or more of these vendors on which your business depends?</p>
<p>The following supply chain risks are common:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0031">
<li>Financial instability of provider</li>
<li>Single points of failure</li>
<li>Data breaches</li>
<li>Malware infestations</li>
<li>Data loss</li>
</ul>
<p>Even more common are natural disasters. What if the data center of your cloud provider is destroyed by an act of nature like the a hurricane or earthquake?</p>
<p>ISO 28000:2007 defines a set of security management requirements, including those that must be applied to all parties within a supply chain. However, ensuring the suitability of each vendor in the supply chain for meeting those requirements and enforcing them up and down the supply chain is the responsibility of the contracting organization. In other words, if you pay someone else to perform a service that in any way might affect your customers, you are obligated to ensure that the entities you’ve paid are subject to governance equivalent to what you’ve promised your customers and that your subcontractors are <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="288" id="Page_288"></span>following that governance. ISO 28000:2007 also provides for a certification against certain elements that relate to supply chain risk:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0032">
<li>Security management policy</li>
<li>Organizational objectives</li>
<li>Risk management practices</li>
<li>Documented practices and records</li>
<li>Supplier relationships</li>
<li>Roles, responsibilities, and authorities</li>
<li>Organizational procedures and processes</li>
</ul>
<p>As the standard grows in popularity with cloud providers, it will in all likelihood be more widely adopted in the future. Much like STAR, ISO certification gives the consumer some level of assurance that the appropriate controls are in place to secure data and privacy.</p></section>

<h3><a id="usec0022"></a>Manage Communication with Relevant Parties</h3>
<p>Both the cloud provider and cloud customers will have to establish durable, resilient lines of communication for business partners along the supply chain for a variety of reasons/purposes. Of particular interest are the following:</p>
<ul id="c11-list-0033">
<li><b>Vendors and Partners:</b> Clear communications with vendors is necessary in order to ensure adequate quantities and types of resources/assets are available for operations. This can be especially true for emergency/contingency situations, where the immediacy/availability of resources is crucial (such as fuel for generators, replacement components for damaged systems, and so on).</li>
<li><b>Customers: </b><i>Customers</i> can mean either individual end users of a product/service or a business that receives products/services in a supply chain. Communication with customers is essential to manage expectations (for instance, alerting customers prior to an interruption of service), maintain brand awareness, and ensure logistic needs are being met. Again, this is particularly true during disaster situations, where delivery may be delayed or interrupted. This might also be required by law, as in those situations involving privacy data, in jurisdictions affected by data breach notification laws.</li>
<li><b>Regulators:</b> In regulated industries, where a third party determines your ability to conduct business, maintaining communications with regulators is crucial. Regulators should be made aware of any situation where the organization might become noncompliant with pertinent standards or regulation (such as during disasters or in the aftermath of a crime). Regulators should be kept apprised of developments, potential solutions being considered by management, any stopgap measures or compensatory controls used in the interim, and the estimated duration until compliance resumes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For communications with all parties in the supply chain, secondary and even tertiary communications capabilities are highly recommended, especially for disaster situations. (Don’t rely on the telephone to be working during a disaster.)</p></section>
