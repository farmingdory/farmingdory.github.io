International courts and tribunals weigh in on laws and regulations concerning global networking. There is also no shortage of laws, regulations, and standards that require compliance. The combination of all these factors provides a rich arena for discussion.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the nature of cloud computing lends itself to resource sharing based on demand as opposed to location. Therefore, data centers located around the world store cloud data and run applications from multiple sources simultaneously. This presents challenges with security and privacy issues due to the complexity of local and international laws, regulations, and guidelines. In this chapter, I will attempt to provide a background and review of the important concepts, laws, regulations, and standards so that the CCSP candidate can provide sound advice and guidance when navigating these complex waters.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0002">
<h2><a id="usec0002"></a>Legal Requirements and Unique Risks in the Cloud Environment</h2>
<p>As one might imagine, the list of US and international laws, regulations, and standards is quite lengthy and complex. The global economy spans multiple continents, many nation-states, and government entities. From the Asia-Pacific region to Australia and New Zealand, the European Union (EU), Eastern Bloc countries, and South America, a wide range of laws, regulations, and rules govern both data privacy and security safeguards. In the following sections, we will begin by exploring some fundamental legal concepts to help the CCSP candidate prepare for working in this complex global environment. To make matters even more concerning, there is no shortage of change and uncertainty.</p><section id="c10-sec-0003">
<h3><a id="usec0003"></a>Legal Concepts</h3>
<p>Let’s begin our discussion with some basic legal concepts that can be applied both in the United States and internationally. These terms form the foundation of knowledge that allows us to operate cloud activities across international borders with some semblance of consistency and fairness. We’ll use US law as a template, but with the caveat that other legal systems may take very different approaches to similar concepts.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="240" id="Page_240"></span>There are three general bodies of law in the United States: criminal law, civil law, and administrative law. There is another specific specialized body of law, unique to the military, known as the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). If your organization is not involved directly in military work, the UCMJ does not usually affect you, so we won’t dwell on that topic, but we’ll address the other three. We’re also going to examine the concept of intellectual property and the legal protections available for owners of this type of asset.</p><section id="c10-sec-0004">
<h4><a id="usec0004"></a>Criminal Law</h4>
<p>Criminal law involves all legal matters where the government is in conflict with any person, group, or organization that violates statutes. Statutes (state and federal) are legislated by lawmakers. They are rules that define conduct prohibited by the government and are designed to provide for the safety and well-being of the public. One example is traffic laws, which when broken result in court appearances, fines, and so on. Other more obvious examples are laws involving robbery, theft, and murder.</p>
<p>Criminal law includes the federal court system and the various state courts. Under criminal law, punishments can include monetary fines, imprisonment, and even death. Enforcement of criminal law is called prosecution. Only the government can conduct law enforcement activity and prosecutions.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c10-feafxd-0001">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> For the security practitioner, it is important to keep in mind that privacy violations around the world are in some cases seen as criminal violations. For instance, if certain privacy standards and procedures are not adequately followed—say, in the EU—you can be prosecuted for criminal violations, in addition to whatever damages result from the data breach.</p>
</section>
<section id="c10-sec-0005">
<h5><a id="usec0005"></a>State Laws</h5>
<p>State laws are those that we typically think of on a day-to-day basis. Speed limits, state tax laws, the criminal code, and so on are all examples of laws enacted by a state legislature as opposed to those enacted at the national or federal level. Federal laws, however, often supersede state laws, particularly regarding the nature of interstate commerce. For instance, while many states have laws outlining how electronic medical records should be handled, federal legislation is usually more comprehensive and therefore followed. In some cases, such as California, the state law may in fact be more stringent, in which case it is followed.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c10-feafxd-0002">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> The United States is divided into 50 member entities that are referred to as <i>states</i>, each with its own jurisdictional sovereignty, legislature, and regulatory bodies. Outside of the United States, most other countries use the word <i>state</i> as a synonym for <i>country</i>, and their member entities are known as <i>counties</i>, <i>jurisdictions</i>, <i>zones</i>, or a variety of other terms. It is important to keep this distinction in mind regarding the meaning of the word <i>state</i> when dealing with multiple nations. In the United States alone, there are over 300 various jurisdictions, each with its own capacity for making and enforcing laws or regulations.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="c10-sec-0006">
<h5><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="241" id="Page_241"></span><a id="usec0006"></a>Federal Laws</h5>
<p>Unlike state laws, federal laws affect the entire country. Generally, issues of jurisdiction and subsequent prosecution are negotiated between law enforcement and courts prior to prosecution of a particular case.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c10-feafxd-0003">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> As of 2005, the US Department of Justice clarified that anyone who “knowingly” violates HIPAA regulations can face fines but also up to one year in jail. Although not a testing requirement, it may be interesting for you to know that the Final Omnibus Rule of March 2013 states that a Tier 3 criminal violation carries a potential 10-year imprisonment penalty. Specifically, it states “if the offense is committed with intent to sell, transfer, or use individually identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm, be fined not more than $250,000, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.” See <a class="codeLabel" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1320d-6">www.law .cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1320d-6</a>.</p>

<h4><a id="usec0007"></a>Civil Law</h4>
<p>Civil law is the body of law, statutes, and so on that deals with personal and community-based law such as marriage and divorce. It is the set of rules that govern private citizens and their disputes. As opposed to criminal law, the parties involved in civil law matters are strictly private entities, including individuals, groups, and organizations.</p>
<p>Typical examples of civil law cases are disputes (in the United States) over property boundaries, contracts, mineral rights, and divorce. Civil cases are called lawsuits or litigation. Punitive measures for civil cases can include restitution of monetary damages or requirement to perform actions (usually in response to a breach-of-contract case, which we’ll address later), but not imprisonment or death.</p><section id="c10-sec-0008">
<h5><a id="usec0008"></a>Contracts</h5>
<p>A contract is an agreement between parties to engage in some specified activity, usually for mutual benefit. The contract between the cloud customer and cloud provider is a perfect example: in that contract, the cloud customer agrees to give the cloud provider money, and in exchange, the cloud provider agrees to give the cloud customer some services. The contract often includes a finite duration for which the contract is in effect, a list of parties involved, the means for dispute resolution, and the jurisdiction of the contract (a physical place or government, such as “the state of Wisconsin,” or “the city of Milwaukee, in the state of Wisconsin, in the United States”).</p>
<p>Disputes arise from failure to perform according to activity specified in the contract, which is called a <i>breach</i>. In the event of a breach, a party to the contract can sue the others in order to get court-ordered relief in the form of money or other considerations (such as property, or the court forcing the breaching party to perform the activity that both parties agreed to in the first place).</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="242" id="Page_242"></span>Contract law applies to contractual items the CCSP candidate should be familiar with, such as the following items:</p>
<ul id="c10-list-0013">
<li>Service-level agreements (SLAs)</li>
<li>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) contracts</li>
</ul>
<p>A CCSP should be prepared to deal with these types of contracts in a cloud environment and/or with cloud customers. Furthermore, it is important to understand the distinctions regarding consequences and ramifications for violations of such contracts.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c10-feafxd-0004">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> <i>Common law</i> is the existing set of rulings and decisions made by courts, informed by cultural mores and legislation. These create <i>precedents</i>, which each party will cite in court as a means to sway the court to their own side of a case. In some jurisdictions, the use of precedents is not allowed; the facts and circumstances of each case stand on their own.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="c10-sec-0009">
<h4><a id="usec0009"></a>Administrative Law</h4>
<p>The other body of law is administrative law—laws not created by legislatures but by executive decision and function. Many federal agencies can create, monitor, and enforce their own administrative law. These agencies have their own lawmaking departments, law enforcement personnel, courts, and judges that belong exclusively to them. For instance, federal tax law is administered by the IRS, which creates those laws, investigates and enforces them with IRS agents, and decides outcomes in cases tried by lawyers and adjudicated by judges both in the employ of the IRS.</p></section>

<h3><a id="usec0010"></a>US Laws</h3>
<p>I will now describe and discuss US laws with the largest impact on cloud computing and with which the CCSP should be familiar. While there are emerging state laws that are more stringent and restrictive than federal laws within their jurisdictions, we will focus on US federal laws as they apply to cloud computing. <a id="tableanchor10-1" role="doc-backlink" href="Chapter 10 Legal and Compliance Part 1 _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html#table10-1">Table 10.1</a> gives an overview of the most prominent US laws and regulations.</p>

Ostensibly, the government would also be the entity enforcing and administering this law, and government law enforcement agencies would be the entities most likely to violate the law in the course of their activities. The reader can readily see the issues that might arise from this circular construct.</p>

<p>Although it isn’t a law, it is helpful for you to know about FedRAMP. FedRAMP is a US federal program that mandates a standardized approach to security assessments, authorization, and continuous monitoring of cloud products and services. FedRAMP certification can be quite costly and difficult to achieve but is required for cloud hosting services provided to a US government agency or contractor.</p>

<h4><a id="usec0011"></a>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)</h4>
<p>The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), enacted in 1996, is a set of federal laws governing the handling of electronic protected health information (ePHI). The stated purpose of the law when it was enacted was to make it easier for patients to access their own medical data and move it between medical providers. However, after a decade of changes, it is more about the adoption of national standards for electronic medical transactions and national identifiers for providers, medical insurers, and employers. ePHI can be stored and processed in the cloud but must have adequate security and privacy protections in place.</p>
<p>The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is the federal enforcement arm of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). They conduct audits, or subcontract to other third-party companies to perform such audits, and are responsible for reporting to DHHS any negative audit findings, policy violations, unreported breaches, and related questionable activity. DHHS then has the authority to impose fines, restrictions, or remedial requirements based on OCR findings.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c10-feafxd-0006">
<h4 style="background-color: #E7E7E8;">HIPAA, the Privacy Rule, and the Security Rule</h4>
<p>When HIPAA first passed in the 1990s, privacy of patient information was the primary concern. The Internet was still in its infancy and no one had even thought of a data breach of PHI, because it had never happened. The first primary regulation promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was the Privacy Rule. It contained language specific to maintaining the privacy of patient information as it was traditionally stored and used, on paper. It was also one of the first regulations in the United States to specifically address privacy.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="245" id="Page_245"></span>With the explosion of networking, digital storage, and the Internet came the Security Rule and the Breach Notification Rule, followed by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH)&nbsp;Act of 2009, which provided financial incentives for medical practices and hospitals to convert paper recordkeeping systems to digital formats. Because data breaches began to happen more and more often, this was an attempt to address issues surrounding this explosion in electronic digital storage of medical information while cloud computing was still in its infancy.</p>
<p>The Security Rule has attempted to address the problems encountered with this explosion of digital patient and medical records information processing and storage. As a result, there are now both a Privacy Rule and a Security Rule associated with HIPAA.

<h4><a id="usec0012"></a>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)</h4>
<p>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, was created to allow banks and financial institutions to merge. Lawmakers were wary of customer concerns that this type of consolidation might detract from individual privacy, so GLBA also includes a great many provisions specifying the kinds of protections and controls that financial institutions are required to use for securing customers’ account information. For example, it requires all financial institutions to have a written information security plan, and later revisions require that an information security officer be named and given adequate resources in order to implement the plan.</p>

<h4><a id="usec0013"></a>Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX)</h4>
<p>At the latter part of the last century, a number of large companies experienced total and unexpected financial collapse because of fraudulent accounting practices, poor audit practices, inadequate financial controls, and poor oversight by governing boards of directors. Some of the companies involved are now a distant memory (Enron, WorldCom, and Adelphia, for example). As a result, in 2002 the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) was enacted as an attempt to prevent these kinds of poor practices and fraudulent activities from occurring in the future. It applies to all publicly traded corporations in the United States.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the organization responsible for establishing SOX standards and guidelines and conducting audits and imposing subsequent fines should any be required.</p>

<h3><a id="usec0015"></a>Laws, Frameworks, and Standards Around the World</h3>
<p>Sovereign countries also have their own laws, applicable to their own jurisdictions. The <i>jurisdiction</i> is the land and people subject to a specific court or courts. The effects of a country’s laws does not cease at its borders, though. If a citizen from another country, or even one of the country’s citizens operating outside that country, breaks that country’s law, they can still be subject to prosecution and punishment by that country. For instance, a hacker that uses the Internet to attack a target in another country could be subject to that country’s computer security laws. The hacker might be extradited (forcibly apprehended in their own country and transported to the country where the law was broken) to face trial. Because there is no global uniformity in how these laws are written and applied, the practitioner is strongly advised to consult with counsel whenever legal matters arise.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand the distinctions of laws and principles of various nations because cloud providers and customers might be operating in many different jurisdictions. The cloud is not limited to the borders of any given country.</p>
<p>While many of the legal definitions and principles in the United States apply to other parts of the world, there are some significant differences. The European Union (EU) has for many years taken a much stronger stance on privacy than the United States. In fact, the EU treats personal privacy protections for data in electronic form as a human right, while the United States has no formal, unified personal privacy law. Instead, the United States has certain laws (discussed in the previous sections) that deal with personal privacy for people who engage in activities in specific industries and sectors, such as financial services, medical care, education, and so forth. The EU, on the other hand, is well known for its “opt-in” policies versus the “opt-out” arrangement in the United States. This means that in the EU, generally speaking, in order for someone to access or use an individual’s personal data or private information, that individual must first grant their permission, effectively opting in to that specific instance of sharing information. In the United States, the usual statutory model is just the opposite, wherein individuals must notify any party that the individual has <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="247" id="Page_247"></span>shared information with that the data cannot thereafter be shared outside the limits of that initial agreement.</p>
<p>To clarify, let’s use the example of a bank account. When a person goes to the bank and opens an account, the bank asks for a set of personal information, such as the person’s name, Social Security number, home address, and so on. The person is granting the bank access to that information voluntarily, sharing it with the bank in order to get a bank account. In the United States, the bank is then required (by GLBA) to ask the person if they want to opt out of any additional information-sharing activity. If the person doesn’t want the bank to share that data with any other entity (for instance, the bank might sell that information to other businesses), the person must give the bank a written statement declaring that they are opting out. If the person does not opt out, then the bank is free to share that information however they see fit. GLBA requires that the bank ask the person, in writing, in hard copy, if they want to opt out of any data-sharing activity, at least once a year for every year that bank account stays open. In the EU, on the other hand, if a person were to open a bank account, the bank must ask the person if the person would allow the bank to share the person’s personal data with any other entity. The bank would not be allowed, by law, to share any of that person’s data until and unless the person grants explicit permission to the bank to do so.</p>
<p>Another important concept to consider in dealing with various countries is their approaches to PII. Information that can be used to identify an individual is often referred to in the industry as <i>personally identifiable information</i> (<i>PII</i>). It can include the name and address of the individual. In the EU, PII also includes a person’s mobile phone number, IP address, and other elements. Although people often voluntarily disclose their PII to a variety of entities, this is done with the expectation that those entities will handle and protect their PII in accordance with their respective countries’ regulations. In the EU, the EU GDPR regulates distribution of PII. Many countries use the GDPR as a basic model for their own laws. <a id="tableanchor10-2" role="doc-backlink" href="Chapter 10 Legal and Compliance Part 1 _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html#table10-2">Table 10.2</a> provides an overview of various countries and how their laws relate to the GDPR.</p>

</section>
<p>The following sections sample some laws in various nations that have developed in response to privacy and data security concerns over the past 30 years. This should give the CCSP candidate a broader view of how the world perceives privacy and in particular some of the legal, regulatory, and operational challenges that come with working in a global environment.</p><section id="c10-sec-0016">
<h4><a id="usec0016"></a>EU General Data Protection Regulation</h4>
<p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is probably the most significant, powerful personal privacy law in the world. This overarching regulation describes the appropriate handling of personal and private information of all EU citizens. Any entity (be it a government agency, private company, or individual) gathering the PII of any citizen of the EU is subject to the GDPR.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="249" id="Page_249"></span>The GDPR addresses individual personal privacy by codifying these seven principles:</p>
<p><b>Notice </b>The individual must be informed that personal information about them is being gathered or created.</p>
<p><b>Choice </b>Every individual can choose whether to disclose their personal information. No entity can gather or create personal information about an individual without that individual’s explicit agreement.</p>
<p><b>Purpose </b>The individual must be told the specific use the information will be put to. This includes whether the data will be shared with any other entity.</p>
<p><b>Access </b>The individual is allowed to get copies of any of their own information held by any entity.</p>
<p><b>Integrity </b>The individual must be allowed to correct any of their own information if it is inaccurate.</p>
<p><b>Security </b>Any entity holding an individual’s personal information is responsible for protecting that information and is ultimately liable for any unauthorized disclosure of that data.</p>
<p><b>Enforcement </b>All entities that have any personal data of any EU citizen understand that they are subject to enforcement actions by EU authorities.</p>
<p>This list largely conforms to a set of principles created by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD is a standards organization made up of representatives from many countries, and it publishes policy suggestions. Its standards are <i>not</i> legally binding and do not have the effect of a treaty or other law.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c10-feafxd-0008">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> This is an important distinction to be made: although the OECD’s principles are not legally binding, the EU’s GDPR, which largely conforms to the OECD’s principles, <i>is</i> legally binding.</p>
</section>
<p>In addition to these principles, the GDPR also resulted in a principle unique to the EU: the “right to be forgotten.” Under this principle, any individual can notify any entity that has PII for that individual and instruct that entity to delete and destroy all of that individual’s PII in that entity’s control. This is a very serious and powerful individual right, and compliance can be extremely difficult. Google disputed this principle when it was first proposed, claiming that the company would find it almost impossible to comply. The European Union High Court decided in favor of the right to be forgotten and against Google, and Google had to choose to accept compliance in order to operate in the EU.</p>
<p>Another major provision of the GDPR was to prohibit any entity from collecting the PII of any EU citizen if that entity existed within the jurisdiction of a country that did not have a national law that explicitly supported all the provisions of the GDPR. This meant, for instance, that any company in the United States would not be allowed to do business with EU citizens. The United States does not have a federal law that directly maps to the GDPR.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="250" id="Page_250"></span>The Europeans have a dim view of the ability of the United States to ensure the privacy of individuals. The GDPR is a direct reflection of this attitude. And, in all fairness, the Europeans seem quite justified in their opinion, as the US government has proven over a considerable period of time to be willing to collect information on all individuals (including citizens of the United States) without warrants or other legal justification. So the GDPR can be seen as a law that expressly limits US companies.</p>
<p>To allow some US-based companies to operate legitimately inside the EU, the EU created privacy rules designed to outline what American companies must do in order to comply with EU laws. These rules outlined the proper handling of storage and transmission of private information belonging to EU citizens. The program for American compliance with GDPR is called Privacy Shield in the United States.</p>
<p>The Privacy Shield provisions are as follows:</p>
<ul id="c10-list-0015">
<li>Any US company that wants to collect EU citizen data must voluntarily agree to comply with the GDPR.</li>
<li>These companies have to sign up with a federal enforcement entity in the United States that administers the program. For most companies, the Privacy Shield program is administered by the Department of Commerce (DoC). For airlines and shipping companies, the program is administered by the Department of Transportation (DoT).</li>
<li>The companies have to agree to allow auditing and enforcement by the program administrators. For the DoC, the enforcement arm is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the DoT enforced its own program. Enforcement can include fines assessed for violations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about Privacy Shield, see <a class="codeLabel" href="http://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">www.privacyshield.gov/welcome</a>.</p>
<p>There is one final method that American companies can use if they want to have EU citizen PII and if they don’t want to subscribe to Privacy Shield. They can create internal policies called <i>binding corporate rules</i> and <i>standard contractual clauses</i> that explicitly state full compliance with the GDPR. In this way, the company that chooses to use this method is basically stating their full agreement to be governed by the applicable EU laws. If a company chooses to use this method, however, it must first approach every individual EU country where the company wants to operate and have the government office responsible for oversight and enforcement of the GDPR accept and approve the company’s policy.</p>
<p>The GDPR defines roles for entities involved in the collection and creation of PII. It is important for the CCSP candidate to be familiar with these roles and how they apply to the relationship between cloud customers and providers.</p>
<p><b>Data Subject </b>The individual to whom the PII refers. A specific human being.</p>
<p><b>Data Controller </b>Any entity collecting or creating PII. In the cloud, the data controller is the cloud customer.</p>
<p><b>Data Processor </b>Any entity acting on behalf or at the behest of the data controller, performing any manipulation, storage, or transmission of the PII. In the cloud, the data processor is the cloud service provider.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="251" id="Page_251"></span>Under the GDPR, the data controller is ultimately responsible for <i>any</i> unauthorized disclosure of PII. That includes any malicious or negligent act on the part of the data processor. This is an extremely important point to understand. Legally, the data controller is responsible for all breaches, regardless of fault.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, let’s say a cloud provider, Ostrich Corporation, has two customers, Acme, Inc., and Bravo, LLC, who are competitors. An administrator at Ostrich knowingly and willingly takes some Acme privacy data and sells it to Bravo. For purposes of liability under privacy laws, Acme would <i>still</i> be responsible for the breach, even though Acme did nothing wrong. Acme might eventually be able to recover damages from Ostrich (and maybe Bravo) in a civil suit, but the legal liability for the privacy data breach, including any initial legal costs for settling the breach, would be Acme’s. Note that this is just for exposure under privacy laws; Ostrich and Bravo might still be prosecuted for the theft of the data, which is a crime.</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c10-feafxd-0009">
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> Under the GDPR, PII is not limited to electronic data. It also covers any data stored in hard-copy form.</p>

<h4><a id="usec0017"></a>Australian Privacy Act of 1988</h4>
<p>The Australian Privacy Act regulates the handling of personal information. It includes details regarding the collection, use, storage, disclosure, access to, and correction of personal information. It consists of fundamental privacy principles covering such issues as these:</p>
<ul id="c10-list-0016">
<li>Transparency in the handling of personal information</li>
<li>The rules on collecting information from solicitation</li>
<li>Correctness and integrity of collected data</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see from the enactment date, Australia has been very proactive in the area of personal privacy rights for decades. It has also become host to a number of global cloud providers, making this law even more important.</p>
<p>Because the Australian Privacy Act meets all the requirements of the EU GDPR, Australian entities are allowed to collect and create PII for EU citizens.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0018">
<h4><a id="usec0018"></a>Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)</h4>
<p>This Canadian law provides for the protection of personal information collected, used, or disclosed in certain circumstances by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions. It includes such specifics on filing complaints as how and with whom they are filed and the remedies and enforcements available to the government for redress of such grievances. As you might imagine, Canada has a view of personal privacy more like that of the EU and unlike the United States.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="252" id="Page_252"></span>The EU acknowledges PIPEDA as satisfactorily addressing the principles of the GDPR. Therefore, entities in Canada (like those in Australia) can handle EU citizen PII.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0019">
<h4><a id="usec0019"></a>Argentina’s Personal Data Protection Act</h4>
<p>In 2000, Argentina passed the Data Protection Act with the explicit intent of ensuring adherence and compliance with the EU Data Directive (the legal precursor to the GDPR). Because of this, the EU treats entities in Argentina as if they were in the EU and allows them to collect and create PII for EU citizens. Many data centers in Argentina exist that manage services for EU customers.</p></section>

<h4><a id="usec0020"></a>The EFTA and Switzerland</h4>
<p>Switzerland is not technically a member of the EU. Instead, it is a member of a four-nation smaller body known as the European Free Trade Association&nbsp;(EFTA). Swiss law has long been famous for protecting client privacy, specifically to support Switzerland’s international banking industry. The EU recognizes EFTA regulation as stringent enough to protect EU citizen data under the GDPR, so Switzerland is ostensibly considered part of the EU in regard to being allowed to process privacy information.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0021">
<h4><a id="usec0021"></a>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework</h4>
<p>The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a regional organization meant to work toward economic growth and cooperation of its member nations. APEC agreements are not legally binding and are followed only with voluntary compliance by those entities that choose to participate.</p>
<p>Where the laws of some other jurisdictions (such as the EU) are meant to provide governmental protections to individual citizens, the APEC intent is to enhance the function of free markets through common adherence to PII protection principles. APEC members understand that consumers will not trust markets if their PII is not protected during participation in those markets. Therefore, APEC principles offer reassurance to consumers as an effort to increase faith in trading practices and thereby ensure mutual benefit for all involved.</p>
<p>APEC framework privacy principles rest on the following core ideas:</p>
<ul id="c10-list-0017">
<li>Individuals know when their data is used, transmitted, or stored.</li>
<li>Limitations on usage are based on what is known to the individuals.</li>
<li>The entity collecting or creating PII has responsibilities toward maintaining data accuracy and integrity.</li>

<h3><a id="usec0022"></a>Information Security Management Systems (ISMSs)</h3>
<p>ISO created the concept of an information security management system (ISMS); a holistic overview of the entire security program within an organization. The ISMS is detailed in ISO 27001.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="253" id="Page_253"></span>The ISMS is intended to provide a standardized international model for the development and implementation of policies, procedures, and standards that take into account stakeholder identification and involvement in a top-down approach to addressing and managing risk in an organization. It is built on the premise that information should be adequately secured with practices accepted and recognized by the industry as a whole; it is platform/product agnostic and can be customized for any organization.</p>
<p>ISO 27001 is probably the most well-recognized security program standard globally and will be accepted by many regulators/jurisdictions as meeting due care requirements for reducing liability. However, applying the standard, and being certified as having applied it, is not inexpensive; ISO compliance is a very costly prospect, which may make it unattractive or impossible for small and medium-sized organizations.</p>

<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) created ISO/IEC 27017:2015, a set of standards regarding the guidelines for information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services and cloud service customers. In other words, it provides a set of standards for not only providing cloud services but also for how cloud customer information and privacy should be controlled. Although ISO standards are recognized internationally, they are not law, and they do not reflect regulation by governmental bodies such as the EU. However, in some jurisdictions, some industries are required by law to comply with ISO standards.</p>

<h3><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="254" id="Page_254"></span><a id="usec0024"></a>The Difference between Laws, Regulations, and Standards</h3>
<p>So what is the difference between all of these laws, regulations, standards, and frameworks? Laws are legal rules that are created by government entities such as legislatures. Regulations are rules that are created by governmental agencies. Failure to properly follow laws and regulations can result in punitive procedures that can include fines and imprisonment.</p>
<p>Standards dictate a reasonable level of performance; standards can be created by an organization for its own purposes (internal) or come from industry bodies/trade groups (external). An organization can choose to adhere to a standard the organization selects; in some cases, for some industries and jurisdictions, compliance with standards is imposed by law. Following a standard can reduce liability; demonstrating that compliance represents due care.</p>
<p>Laws, regulations, and standards can all impact the information security industry, often in similar or overlapping ways. For example, there are laws, regulations, and standards that all dictate and describe what sorts of data should be considered sensitive and personal information.</p>
<p>Rules related to the handling of sensitive data might come from another source, as well: contractual agreements. For instance, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance is wholly voluntary, but it is a requirement for those who choose to participate in credit card processing (namely, merchants who accept credit card payments). Those participants agree to submit to PCI oversight, including audits and review of the participants’ adoption and implementation of standards and applicable controls. It’s not a law, but it is a framework, complete with enforcers. For more information about the PCI council and the PCI Data Security Standard, go to <a class="codeLabel" href="http://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">www.pcisecuritystandards.org</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you’re dealing with laws, regulations, or standards, everyone expects a reasonable degree of transparency—in other words, making things clear for all types of regulators and interested parties, at least to the degree that is expected and possible.</p>

<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="public/note.jpg" alt="Image of Note" width="71" height="44"> There are descriptions of the differences between laws and contracts at the beginning of this chapter; privacy data can be affected by both laws and contracts. Under a law, your organization has to answer to the government in the event of a PII breach/loss; under a contract, your organization will have to answer to the other party/parties of the contract.</p>

<h2><a id="usec0025"></a>Potential Personal and Data Privacy Issues in the Cloud Environment</h2>
<p>Due to the decentralized nature of cloud computing, geographic disparities make personal privacy and data privacy critical issues. In the following sections, we will discuss some of the challenges to protecting and managing personal privacy and data privacy in such a decentralized, dispersed, and global environment.</p><section id="c10-sec-0026">
<h3><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="255" id="Page_255"></span><a id="usec0026"></a>eDiscovery</h3>
<p>Electronic discovery (eDiscovery) refers to the process of identifying and obtaining electronic evidence for either prosecutorial or litigation purposes. Determining which data in a set is pertinent to a specific legal case can be difficult. Regardless of whether information is stored in databases, records, email, or files, identifying and locating applicable data can be quite challenging in the cloud due to the decentralized nature of the technology. Moreover, because cloud computing so often takes the form of a multitenant environment, there is added complication in finding data owned by a specific customer while not intruding on other customers’ data that might be located in the same storage volumes, the same drives, or the same machines. Trained professionals certified in the practice of eDiscovery are rare, and most organizations don’t have these people in their employ. When faced with eDiscovery activity, an organization would probably best be served by hiring a consultant who is expert and licensed for the purpose. Anyone performing this activity should be extremely familiar with relevant industry standards and guidance, such as ISO 27050 (<a class="codeLabel" href="http://www.iso.org/standard/63081.html">www.iso.org/standard/63081.html</a>) and CSA guidance (<a class="codeLabel" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/csa-security-guidance-domain-3-legal-issues-contracts-and-electronic-discovery/">https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/ csa-security-guidance-domain-3-legal-issues-contracts-and-electronic-discovery/</a>).</p>
<p>It is important for the cloud customer to be familiar with laws, SLAs, and other contractual agreements that can impact the user’s ability to conduct eDiscovery should the need arise. This is especially important if international boundaries are crossed in the process.</p>
<p>As demand for eDiscovery capability increases, technology vendors have created products to meet this need. Some cloud providers offer SaaS eDiscovery solutions; cloud-based applications that can perform searches and collection of pertinent data (often in the provider’s own cloud data center, for its own customers). There are also host-based tools that can be used to locate applicable information on specific machines (both hardware and virtualized).</p><section id="c10-sec-0027">
<h4><a id="usec0027"></a>Chain of Custody and Nonrepudiation</h4>
<p>All evidence needs to be tracked and monitored from the time it is recognized as evidence and acquired for that purpose until the time it is delivered to a court or law enforcement agency. Clear documentation must record which people had access to the evidence, where the evidence was stored, what access controls were placed on the evidence, and what modifications or analysis was performed on the evidence. We call this record and the principles for creating it the <i>chain of custody</i>.</p>
<p>Being able to demonstrate a strong chain of custody, where only specific, trusted personnel had access to the material and with no gaps in the timeline or loss of control, is very important for making an argument in court using that evidence. Any discrepancy in the chain of custody introduces doubt as to the disposition and content of the evidence. Although this does not make the evidence inadmissible, it does allow an opportunity for opposing counsel to reduce the power of your narrative. Any doubt regarding a particular piece or set of evidence will make that evidence much weaker.</p>
<p>When creating policies for maintaining a chain of custody or conducting activities requiring the preservation and monitoring of evidence, it is best to get input and guidance <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="256" id="Page_256"></span>from counsel and perhaps even to use specialized consultants who are trained and experienced in this practice area.</p>
<p>The chain of custody provides <i>nonrepudiation</i> for the transactions detailed in the evidence. Nonrepudiation means that no party to a transaction can later claim that they did not take part.</p></section>

<h3><a id="usec0028"></a>Forensic Requirements</h3>
<p>Conducting forensic activity in a cloud environment is challenging. The nature of decentralized, off-premises data and its movement, storage, and processing across geopolitical boundaries all lead to a complex and perplexing environment when attempting to gather and analyze forensic data.</p>
<p>The international nature of cloud forensics has created the demand for international standards that are applicable globally. Such standards help establish procedures across borders in an effort to limit the challenges to scientific findings.</p>
<p>ISO has developed a set of global digital forensics standards:</p>
<ul id="c10-list-0018">
<li><b>ISO/IEC 27037:2012:</b> Guide for collecting, identifying, and preserving electronic evidence</li>
<li><b>ISO/IEC 27041:2015:</b> Guide for incident investigations</li>
<li><b>ISO/IEC 27042: 2015:</b> Guide for digital evidence analysis</li>
<li><b>ISO/IEC 27043:2015:</b> Incident investigation principles and processes</li>
<li><b>ISO/IEC 27050-1:2016:</b> Overview and principles for eDiscovery</li>
</ul></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0029">
<h3><a id="usec0029"></a>Conflicting International Legislation</h3>
<p>The Internet and cloud facilitate international commerce, allowing individuals and businesses to trade goods and services worldwide. This can lead to legal difficulties because jurisdictions might have conflicting laws for similar activity. For instance, online gambling is against the law in the United States, but is perfectly legal in many other parts of the world; providers offering services to American players may be subject to prosecution in the US (see the “Online Gambling” case study). Cloud service providers may also have to comply with local requirements that differ greatly from the laws within the country where the service is headquartered or be forced to deviate from their own internal policies as well; for example, in order for Google to provide service in China, Google is required to disclose user behavior to the Chinese government, even though it is readily apparent that this reporting might be used to prosecute and persecute users for behavior that is normalized in Google’s home country (the US) but illegal in China (Chinese citizens engaged in “dissident” activity or participating in LGBT-oriented activities can face criminal charges).</p>
<p>It is imperative that the CCSP be aware of the various laws affecting their organizations’ activities and users in the jurisdictions in which they do business, including the location of cloud data centers, providers, and end users. Contracts with cloud providers must be reviewed in detail for legal impacts in both the provider’s and customer’s jurisdictions.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="257" id="Page_257"></span>Finally, as practitioners in the field of information security, we should all be aware of legal developments that might cause conflicts to arise in our international operations, such as laws that might dictate behavior in one jurisdiction that is illegal in another. (The CLOUD Act requires companies in the US to disclose data to federal law enforcement, even if that data is located outside the US and the disclosure might be against the law in the jurisdiction where the data is located.)</p>
<section class="feature3" id="c10-feafxd-0014">
<h4 style="background-color: #E7E7E8;"><img src="public/real.png" alt="Image of Real World Scenario" width="234" height="36"><br> Online Gambling</h4>
<p>Sometimes, what is against the law in one jurisdiction is not against the law in another. In those circumstances, extradition can be difficult. If the person’s actions are not illegal in their home nation and another nation wants to arrest them and bring them to trial, the home nation might refuse any such requests.</p>
<p>This was the case for David Carruthers, the CEO of a British-based online gambling company. In 2006, Carruthers was arrested by federal agents in the United States while he was changing planes in Dallas, between a flight from the UK and a flight to Costa Rica. The US government charged Carruthers with “racketeering,” stemming from the use of his company’s services by US citizens engaging in online gambling.</p>
<p>Online gambling, while illegal in the United States, is not illegal in the UK or Costa Rica, nor in many other parts of the world. It would have been difficult for the United States to extradite Carruthers from either the UK or Costa Rica because of this difference in the laws of the various countries, so federal agents waited until he was in the jurisdiction of the United States—the moment his plane touched down.</p>
<p>Carruthers served 33 months in prison.</p>

<h3><a id="usec0030"></a>Cloud Forensic Challenges</h3>
<p>The distributed model of cloud computing presents a number of challenges in the area of forensics. Data location, collection mechanisms, and international laws are all factors when dealing with situations involving forensic investigations.</p>
<p>Do you know where your data is to start with? Are some parts of it on-premises or off-premises, and in either case where is the data located? Is it distributed across multiple data centers, and if so, are those data centers across international boundaries? If so, do international laws hinder your abilities to collect forensic information? For example, does the law in a certain country/jurisdiction prevent you from capturing certain types of data (detailed user activity records, for instance)?</p>
<p>Do you have a working relationship with your cloud computing vendors? Do your SLA or other contract elements delineate the rights and responsibilities for data collection and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="258" id="Page_258"></span>maintenance between the customer and provider? Are you authorized, as a cloud customer, to retrieve forensic data from the cloud data center? What happens if you accidentally collect another customer’s data from a multitenant environment? Will your forensic tools be suitable for a virtualized environment? What level of cooperation is necessary on the part of the provider?</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0031">
<h3><a id="usec0031"></a>Direct and Indirect Identifiers</h3>
<p>Privacy information can take many forms. In some jurisdictions, under certain laws, a person’s name, birthdate, and home address are considered PII; in other countries/jurisdictions, the person’s mobile phone number and IP address are PII as well; this entirely depends on the laws of those jurisdictions. These PII elements are sometimes referred to as <i>direct identifiers</i>. Direct identifiers are those data elements that immediately reveal a specific individual.</p>
<p>There are also <i>indirect identifiers</i>, which should also be protected. Indirect identifiers are the characteristics and traits of an individual that, when aggregated, could reveal the identity of that person. Each indirect identifier by itself is usually not sensitive, but if enough are collected they may provide sensitive information. For example, if we take a list of indirect identifiers that are not sensitive, such as a man born in Wisconsin and currently living in New Orleans who owns a dog and performs work in the information security field, we might reveal the identity of the author of this book and thus derive sensitive information (an identity) from information elements that are not sensitive (location, birthplace, pets, industry, and so on).</p>
<p>The act of removing identifiers is known as <i>anonymization</i>; certain jurisdictions, laws, and standards require the anonymization of data, including both direct and indirect identifiers.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0032">
<h3><a id="usec0032"></a>Forensic Data Collection Methodologies</h3>
<p>In traditional environments, forensic data collection is performed in a relatively contained environment (the organization’s enterprise) with a single owner (the organization itself). The collection process is challenging in a traditional environment; care must be taken to ensure data is modified as little as possible and captured in a manner that is consistent, exacting, and repeatable. Certain techniques, like forensic imaging, are used to reduce the possibility that captured data is not affected while copies are made.</p>
<p>In the cloud environment, the practices and tools used in the traditional environment are not always feasible or useful. There are multiple owners of the resources; depending on the cloud service and deployment models, and the cloud provider or the customer might have possession/ownership and/or administrative rights to certain systems/aspects of the environment. Moreover, the additional concern of third-party data (other cloud customers sharing the same underlying infrastructure) that might be affected by forensic collection complicates the process.</p>
<p>In many situations, forensic collection of cloud data will require the participation/involvement of the cloud provider; the customer will not be able (legally or technically or <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="259" id="Page_259"></span>both) to capture the necessary material in a manner or with the detail required for the satisfaction of a court (where evidence gathered and analyzed forensically often ends up).</p>
<p>The ISO standards mentioned earlier (specifically 27037 and 27042) are excellent guides for collecting, preserving, and analyzing forensic data. However, most cloud customers (and most CCSPs) will not have the skills and tools necessary for defensible evidence collection and analysis readily available. It is highly recommended that cloud customers undertaking a forensic investigation in the cloud enlist the services of forensic professionals certified and licensed to perform those activities.</p></section>

<h2><a id="usec0033"></a>Audit Processes, Methodologies, and Cloud Adaptations</h2>
<p>An audit is a review of an environment in order to determine if that environment is compliant with a standard, law, configuration, or other mandate. The audit process in cloud computing, while very much as in any other environment, does have some unique challenges, which we will explore in more detail.</p><section id="c10-sec-0034">
<h3><a id="usec0034"></a>Virtualization</h3>
<p>Cloud computing requires virtualization; virtualization complicates auditing. The auditor is no longer looking at physical devices but software instances or abstractions of devices. Even at the network layer, software-based virtual switches and routers are responsible for moving traffic around the cloud environment. That makes it hard for the auditor to identify all machines in the scope of the audit; the audit is not a simple matter of locating and enumerating tangible devices in a room, as in a traditional environment. At best, the auditor will have access to a management console with which to view the environment. This can at the very least be confusing and difficult for those unaccustomed to cloud computing.</p>
<p>There is also the need to understand the control mechanisms in play in a virtualized cloud environment. Virtualization requires a knowledge base that auditors unfamiliar with cloud technology will find confusing. One example is auditing access to the hypervisor. The auditor can view the accounts of the administrators but may not be able to speak to them as they might reside in a different country.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0035">
<h3><a id="usec0035"></a>Scope</h3>
<p>Audit <i>scope</i> lists which elements, participants, and systems will be included in the audit. Scoping must be performed before the audit begins so that everyone involved (the auditors, the organization being audited, users, etc.) understands the breadth and depth of the audit, how long it may take, and what resources will be utilized/affected.</p>
<p>Defining the scope of an audit in a cloud-computing environment can also present challenges. Are you conducting an audit on the infrastructure of the cloud provider, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="260" id="Page_260"></span>platform, or the applications involved? Depending on the service model you are using, audit scope can take many different forms. For instance, if you are simply using the provider as a software as a service (SaaS) vendor, should your audit scope involve the underlying infrastructure? Many vendors provide third-party audits of those services to satisfy this need so that customers’ auditors can focus on the higher abstraction levels (that is, the providers’ auditors will review the hardware in the data center, and the customers’ auditors will review the application and usage).</p>
<p>Additionally, the scope of the audit may or may not be confined to geographical or geopolitical boundaries. The auditor may only be auditing infrastructure as a service (IaaS) within the confines of a certain country. Anything outside these boundaries may be out of scope, depending on the engagement.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0036">
<h3><a id="usec0036"></a>Gap Analysis</h3>
<p>Once the audit has been complete, the audit results should show both where the organization is currently compliant and where it is not compliant. The gap analysis is a review of the differences, in those areas where the organization is not yet compliant with the given standard/regulation. The purpose of the gap analysis is to aid in determining how to reach the desired end state (full compliance).</p>
<p>Generally, best practices dictate that the auditors do <i>not</i> take part in providing specific recommendations on how to close gaps—that auditors do not recommend particular technologies/systems/products for achieving compliance because this may lead to a conflict of interest (where the auditors take part in business functions, diluting the auditors’ independence). Moreover, the affected departments within the organization should also not take part in the gap analysis; instead, personnel from outside the target departments should do the review as they are more able to offer unbiased opinion and suggestions.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0037">
<h3><a id="usec0037"></a>Restrictions of Audit Scope Statements</h3>
<p>If an auditor feels that the organization has not disclosed sufficient information/artifacts/access for the auditor to perform a successful and fair audit, the auditor may issue a “scope limitation” statement or otherwise qualify the audit report/results. This indicates to any recipient of the audit that the auditor did not feel professionally able to render judgement due to the target organization’s desire to withhold elements material to the audit.</p>
<p>For example, an auditor is hired to review Ostrich, Inc., for PCI DSS compliance. The management of Ostrich creates an audit scope that does not allow the auditor to review the point-of-sale systems where customer credit cards are presented at the time of purchase. Because PCI DSS requires that cardholder data is protected from the time of collection, the auditor deems, in the auditor’s professional opinion, that access to the point-of-sale systems is necessary to determine whether Ostrich is performing the data collection in a secure manner and whether Ostrich is compliant with the standard. When the auditor completes the audit report, the auditor may issue a “qualified opinion,” explaining that the report is not sufficient, in the auditor’s estimation, to fairly and completely render a sound judgement. The auditor may also issue a “disclaimer of opinion,” stating that the audit report is not complete and should not be taken as wholly accurate.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="261" id="Page_261"></span>Many popular audit standards and audit bodies, such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) require that auditors note any restrictions on audit scope that may materially impact the quality of the audit.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0038">
<h3><a id="usec0038"></a>Policies</h3>
<p>Policies provide a voice and expression of the strategic goals and objectives of senior management and play an integral role in forming the security posture of an organization.</p>
<p>Organizational security policies take the form of those intended to reduce exposure and minimize risk of financial and data losses as well as other types of damages such as loss of reputation. Other typical policies include information security policy, data classification and usage policies, acceptable use, and a host of other polices related to software, malware, and so on. In addition, the CCSP should be familiar with disaster recovery and business continuity policies, vendor management or outsourcing policies, and incident response and forensic policies. All these policies are an expression of senior management’s strategic goals and objectives with regard to managing and maintaining the risk profile of the organization.</p>
<p>In cloud computing, more emphasis may be placed on policies regarding access controls, data storage and recovery, and so on, where the cloud customer will have some semblance of control; many other policies that were applicable in the traditional IT environment (such as hardware management, personnel access to storage devices, etc.) may not be feasible in a cloud environment as the customer does not have control over those aspects of the cloud. Those, instead, will be in the purview of the cloud provider. However, some policies that an organization may want to dedicate more time and resources to after migrating to the cloud include remote access, password management, encryption, and how duties and responsibilities are separated and managed, especially for administrators.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0039">
<h3><a id="usec0039"></a>Different Types of Audit Reports</h3>
<p>Internal audits are those performed by employees of an organization. Banks will often have an internal audit department and conduct periodic internal reviews in order to assess operational risks and determine whether employees are following policies. They may also conduct ongoing GLBA audits to ensure that they are meeting all FDIC regulations concerning their information security program.</p>
<p>Here are several of the reasons internal audits are weaker than external audits:</p>
<ul id="c10-list-0019">
<li>They tend to get delayed in lieu of activities that meet operational needs.</li>
<li>The people doing the audits may lack experience.</li>
<li>There may be pressure to not disclose security issues for fear of retribution (internal political factors).</li>
</ul>
<p>External audits are performed almost as an audit of internal audits. External audits tend to be more independent because there is greater separation between the auditor and the organization. They also tend to be more thorough, since they typically encompass the entire audit universe as opposed to internal audits of individual departments of the organization.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0040">
<h3><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="262" id="Page_262"></span><a id="usec0040"></a>Auditor Independence</h3>
<p>The idea of auditor independence goes back further than SOX legislation, but SOX stringently reinforced that requirement. This has had a very influential effect on auditors and organizations in the United States and somewhat internationally.</p>
<p>It is imperative that the auditors remain utterly objective and not be swayed by either persuasion or vested interest; the auditors must be unbiased and reflect a true and accurate reporting of the target environment/organization. Auditors should not have a financial interest in the outcome of the audit, or in the success of the organization, nor should auditors have personal interactions with client entities if those relationships could influence the auditors or their reports.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0041">
<h3><a id="usec0041"></a>AICPA Reports and Standards</h3>
<p>The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) represents the accounting and audit professions in the United States. It is a large organization that is responsible for most financial and information security audit practices. It sets the standards, creates the guidelines and frameworks, and sets the bar for service organization audit and reporting practices. The AICPA creates and promulgates the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), which auditors and accountants adhere to in practice.</p>
<p>The current AICPA audit standard, SSAE 18, outlines three families of audit reports: SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3.</p>
<p>These standards, guidelines, and reports serve as the foundation for evaluating the safety and soundness of an organization’s control framework and help to determine risk levels of doing business with the organization. They report on the effectiveness of proper separation and segmentation.</p>
<p>As a CCSP, if your organization is considering cloud migration and you have to choose between potential providers, you will almost always have to rely on third-party audit reports as a means to perform your due diligence (demonstrating that you’ve put forth the effort to choose a trustworthy provider). It is very unlikely that you will be allowed to perform your own audit/site visit/review of the provider’s controls as a customer. This is why (ISC)<sup>2</sup> feels it is important for you to be familiar with the SOC reports and understand what they mean and how they are used.</p>
<p>The first of these reports is called the SOC 1. It is an audit engagement consisting solely of an examination of organizational financial reporting controls. For the purposes of a cloud customer trying to determine the suitability of a cloud provider, the SOC 1 is useless. It doesn’t tell us anything about data protections, configuration resiliency, or any other element the customer needs to know. The SOC 1 is instead designed to serve the needs of investors and regulators, the two sets of people interested in the financial well-being of the target. To restate and reinforce: the SOC 1 does not serve an information security or IT security purpose.</p>
<p>SOC 2 reports review controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. This is the report of most use to cloud customers (to determine the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="263" id="Page_263"></span>suitability of cloud providers) and IT security practitioners. SOC 2 reports come in Type I and Type II flavors. The SOC 2 Type I report only reviews controls as designed, at a particular moment in time. That is, the audit examines the controls chosen by the target but not how those controls are implemented or how well those controls actually work. For a cloud customer, the SOC 2 Type I is interesting but, again, not too useful.</p>
<p>The SOC 2 Type II, on the other hand, is a truly thorough review of the target’s controls, including how they have been implemented and their efficacy, over a period of time (usually several months). The SOC 2 Type II is a goldmine for the cloud customer. It gives the customer a realistic view of the provider’s security posture and overall program.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while the cloud customer will want to see the provider’s SOC 2 Type II audit report, the provider may be reluctant to share it, and rightly so. The SOC 2 Type II is so detailed and contains so much information about the actual security controls implemented within the provider’s environment that it would be a perfect attack map for a hostile actor. It is quite understandable that the cloud provider would not want to disseminate the SOC 2 Type II.</p>
<p>However, current trends in the industry have created a happy middle ground for the provider and the customer. Many cloud providers are offering the SOC 2 Type II reports to their customers with the stipulation that the customer signs a nondisclosure agreement and that the customer is vetted by the provider for trustworthiness before the provider will release the report. This gives assurances to the customer that the provider’s security posture is adequate, and it gives assurances to the provider that their security methods and techniques are not being made available to someone who would want to use that information for malicious ends.</p>
<p>The SOC 3 report, on the other hand, is purely for public consumption and serves only as a seal of approval for public display, without sharing any specific information regarding audit activity, control effectiveness, findings, and so on. It is literally just an attestation from the auditor that the audit has been conducted and that the target has successfully passed the audit. It contains no details and no substance. More cloud providers will be willing to disclose the SOC 3 report than either of the SOC 2 reports because that is what a SOC 3 is designed for. As an accurate reflection of trustworthiness or for due diligence purposes in selecting a provider, it is not a useful or reliable tool.</p></section>

<h2><a id="usec0042"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>As you have seen, the nature of international laws, standards, and regulations make cloud computing complex and at times difficult to comprehend. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have promulgated what have become the de facto standards for information security and privacy for the vast majority of the international community outside the United States. Inside the United States, auditors still work primarily with standards and regulations such as GLBA, PCI-DSS, SSAE18, and HIPAA. Agencies and governmental bodies continually generate these standards and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="264" id="Page_264"></span>regulations, making a consistent standard difficult to obtain. However, it is the CCSP’s responsibility to understand all the challenges these present in order to provide sound advice when working with customers’ and vendors’ architectural, policy, and management efforts.</p></section>
<section id="c10-sec-0043">
<h2><a id="usec0043"></a>Exam Essentials</h2>
<p><b>Have a fundamental understanding of the relevant ISO and ISO/IEC standards, such as ISO 27001. </b>ISO standards are not laws but are derived from experts all over the world who have come together to develop standards from which to operate. Many countries and coalitions such as the EU base many of their policies on ISO-related standards.</p>
<p><b>Be familiar with and have a fundamental grasp of US security and privacy standards, regulations, and laws. </b>This includes contractual and legal compliance regulations, standards, and frameworks such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX, and GLBA. You should know the differences. PCI DSS, for instance, is a contractual standard and not a law. HIPAA, on the other hand, like GLBA, is a federal law, and audits resulting in findings of noncompliance can result in fines, jailtime, and forced interruption of business activity.</p>
<p><b>Have a clear understanding of issues surrounding and relating to eDiscovery. </b>This includes forensic evidence, chain of custody, and the challenges facing forensic collection in a cloud environment. Attempting eDiscovery in a cloud environment can be very challenging due to such things as geographical and geopolitical dispersion.</p>
<p><b>Understand audit processes. </b>Understand basic audit concepts such as internal versus external audits as well as the differences and the importance of independence in conducting audits.
