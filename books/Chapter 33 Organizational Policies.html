<h2 class="h2chap">Organizational Policies</h2>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you will</p>
<p class="bullo">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explore policies used to manage organizational security</p>
<p class="bullo">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examine processes used in risk management of third parties</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent-top">Policies and procedures govern the operation of the organization and represent a set of requirements developed from both internal and external sources. External requirements may come from laws and regulations, contractual terms, or customer specifications. There are regulatory situations where specific business actions are required by law or regulation. In many cases, the laws or regulations specify that specific policies are in place to govern compliance. Understanding the specific requirements of the business environment may require assistance from supporting business functions, guidance from industry groups, or help from other sources. Determining the relevant security policies and procedures that apply to third-party relationships is a key endeavor in ensuring that all elements of them are met during business operations. The bottom line is simple: in some business situations, policies and procedures may be mandated by outside regulation, and assistance may be required in ensuring compliance.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Certification Objective</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter covers CompTIA Security+ exam objective 5.3: Explain the importance of policies to organizational security.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev313">Personnel</h3>
<p class="noindent">A significant portion of human-created security problems results from poor security practices. These poor practices may be those of an individual user who is not following established security policies or processes, or they may be caused by a lack of security policies, procedures, or training within the user’s organization. Through the establishment, enforcement, and monitoring of personnel-related policies—<em>personnel management</em>—an organization can create a framework that empowers its workers to achieve business objects yet keeps them constrained within recommended security practices. This section covers a dozen security topics related to the management of personnel.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec794"><span id="page_596" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Acceptable Use Policy</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <em>acceptable use policy (AUP)</em> outlines what the organization considers to be the appropriate use of its resources, such as computer systems, e-mail, Internet, and networks. Organizations should be concerned about any personal use of organizational assets that does not benefit the company.</p>
<p class="indent">The goal of the policy is to ensure employee productivity while limiting potential organizational liability resulting from inappropriate use of the organization’s assets. The policy should clearly delineate what activities are not allowed. The AUP should address issues such as the use of resources to conduct personal business, installation of hardware or software, remote access to systems and networks, the copying of company-owned software, and the responsibility of users to protect company assets, including data, software, and hardware. Statements regarding possible penalties for ignoring any of the policies (such as termination) should also be included.</p>
<p class="indent">Related to appropriate use of the organization’s computer systems and networks by employees is the appropriate use by the organization. The most important of such issues is whether the organization will consider it appropriate to monitor the employees’ use of the systems and network. If monitoring is considered appropriate, the organization should include a statement to this effect in the banner that appears at login. This repeatedly warns employees, and possible intruders, that their actions are subject to monitoring and that any misuse of the system will not be tolerated. Should the organization need to use in either a civil or criminal case any information gathered during monitoring, the issue of whether the employee had an expectation of privacy, or whether it was even legal for the organization to be monitoring, is simplified if the organization can point to its repeatedly displayed statement that use of the system constitutes consent to monitoring. Before any monitoring is conducted, or the actual wording on the warning message is created, the organization’s legal counsel should be consulted to determine the appropriate way to address this issue.</p>
<p class="indent">AUPs are important enough that they are typically presented to employees during on-boarding, with refreshers on an annual basis. AUPs are the basis for employee behavior with systems, and the details need to be refreshed for people to be able to adhere to them.</p>

<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you understand that an acceptable use policy outlines what is considered acceptable behavior for a computer system’s users. This policy often goes hand-in-hand with an organization’s Internet usage policy.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec795">Job Rotation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another policy that provides multiple benefits is <em>job rotation</em>. Rotating through jobs provides individuals with a better perspective of how the various parts of the organization can enhance (or hinder) the business. Since security is often of secondary concern to people in their jobs, rotating individuals through security positions can result in a much wider understanding of the organization’s security problems. A secondary benefit <span id="page_597" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>is that it also eliminates the need to rely on one individual for security expertise. If all security tasks are the domain of one employee, security will suffer if that individual leaves the organization. In addition, if only one individual understands the security domain, should that person become disgruntled and decide to harm the organization, recovering from their attack could be very difficult.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotating users between roles helps to ensure that fraudulent activity cannot be sustained and improves security awareness across various roles in an organization</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec796">Mandatory Vacation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Organizations have been providing vacation time for their employees for many years. Until recently, however, few organizations forced employees to take this time if they didn’t want to. Some employees are given the choice to either “use or lose” their vacation time, and if they do not take all of their time, they’ll lose at least a portion of it. Many arguments can be made as to the benefit of taking time off, but more importantly, from a security standpoint, an employee who never takes time off is a potential indicator of nefarious activity. Employees who never take any vacation time could be involved in activity such as fraud or embezzlement and might be afraid that if they leave on vacation, the organization would discover their illicit activities. As a result, requiring employees to use their vacation time through a policy of <em>mandatory vacation</em> can be a security protection mechanism. Using mandatory vacation as a tool to detect fraud will require that somebody else also be trained in the functions of the employee who is on vacation. Having a second person familiar with security procedures is also a good policy in case something happens to the primary person.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec797">Separation of Duties</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Separation of duties</em> is a principle employed in many organizations to ensure that no single individual has the ability to conduct transactions alone. This means that the level of trust in any one individual is lessened, and the ability for any individual to cause catastrophic damage to the organization is also lessened. An example might be an organization in which one person has the ability to order equipment, but another individual makes the payment. An individual who wants to make an unauthorized purchase for their own personal gain would have to convince another person to go along with the transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Separating duties as a security tool is a good practice, but it is possible to go overboard and break up transactions into too many pieces or require too much oversight. This results in inefficiency and can actually be less secure, since individuals may not scrutinize transactions as thoroughly because they know others will also be reviewing them. The temptation is to hurry something along and assume that somebody else will examine it or has examined it.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><span id="page_598" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the separation of duties principle is that it spreads responsibilities out over an organization so no single individual becomes the indispensable individual with all of the “keys to the kingdom” or unique knowledge about how to make everything work. If enough tasks have been distributed, assigning a primary and a backup person for each task will ensure that the loss of any one individual will not have a disastrous impact on the organization.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec798">Least Privilege</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the most fundamental principles in security is <em>least privilege,</em> which means that an object (which may be a user, application, or process) should have only the rights and privileges necessary to perform its task, with no additional permissions. Limiting privileges limits the amount of harm the object can cause, thus limiting the organization’s exposure to damage. Users should only have access to the information and systems necessary to perform their job duties. Enforcing the principle of least privilege helps an organization protect its most sensitive resources and helps ensure that whoever is interacting with these resources has a valid reason to do so.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of least privilege states that users should only have a level of access permissions required to perform their job.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec799">Clean Desk Space</h4>
<p class="noindent">Preventing access to information is also important in the work area. Firms with sensitive information should have a <em>clean desk</em> policy specifying that sensitive information must not be left unsecured in the work area when the worker is not present to act as custodian. Even leaving the desk area and going to the bathroom can leave information exposed and subject to compromise. The clean desk policy should identify and prohibit things that are not obvious upon first glance, such as passwords on sticky notes under keyboards and mouse pads or in unsecured desk drawers.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec800">Background Checks</h4>
<p class="noindent">Personnel are key to security in the enterprise. Hiring good personnel has always been a challenge in the technical field, but it is equally important to hire trustworthy people, especially in key roles that have greater system access. Performing routine <em>background checks</em> provides the HR team the necessary information needed to make the correct decisions. Background checks can validate previous employment, criminal backgrounds, financial background, and even social media behavior. Depending on the industry, firm, and position, different elements from these areas may be included.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="page_599" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>It is commonly heard that hiring a talented security hacker requires accepting someone with a shady past. The veracity of that comment aside, the real question to ask is not “Would I hire this person?” but rather “Would I be afraid of firing them?”</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec801">Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA)</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs)</em> are standard corporate documents used to explain the boundaries of company secret material, information over which control should be exercised to prevent disclosure to unauthorized parties. NDAs are frequently used to delineate the level and type of information, and with whom it can be shared. NDAs can be executed between any two parties where one party wishes that the material being shared is not further shared, enforcing confidentiality via contract.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nondisclosure agreements are legally binding documents. Signed NDAs are often required by employers during the onboarding process to ensure employees are aware of privacy and confidentiality concerning company data.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec802">Social Media Analysis</h4>
<p class="noindent">The rise of <em>social media networks and applications</em> has changed many aspects of business. Whether used for marketing, communications, customer relations, or some other purpose, social media networks can be considered a form of third party. One of the challenges in working with social media networks and/or applications is their terms of use. While a relationship with a typical third party involves a negotiated set of agreements with respect to requirements, there is no negotiation with social media networks. The only option is to adopt their terms of service, so it is important to understand the implications of these terms with respect to the business use of the social network.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of social media sites by employees at work brings in additional risks, in the form of viruses, worms, and spear phishing data collection. In years past, employers worried about employees using the machines at work to shop on eBay or surf the Web rather than work. Today, the risks are increased beyond just lost time to now include malware introduction to work machines. It is common for firms to use AUPs to restrict employee personal use of things like social media, peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, BitTorrent, and other non-work-related applications.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec803">Onboarding</h4>
<p class="noindent">A key element when <em>onboarding</em> personnel is to ensure that the personnel are aware of and understand their responsibilities with respect to securing company information and assets. Agreements with business partners tend to be fairly specific with respect to terms associated with mutual expectations associated with the process of the business. <span id="page_600" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Ensuring the correct security elements are covered during onboarding is essential to setting proper employee expectations. These considerations need to be made prior to the establishment of the relationship, not added at the time that it is coming to an end.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onboarding policy should include provisions for the handling of data, the disposal of data, acceptable use, and any sanctions that may occur as a result of misuse.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec804">Offboarding</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Offboarding</em> refers to the processes and procedures used when an employee leaves an organization. From a security perspective, the offboarding process for personnel is very important. Employee termination needs to be modified to include termination or disablement of all accounts, including those enabled on mobile devices. It’s not uncommon to find terminated employees with accounts or even company devices still connecting to the corporate network months after being terminated. E-mail accounts should be removed promptly as part of the employee termination policy and process. Mobile devices supplied by the company should be collected upon termination. Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) equipment should have its access to corporate resources terminated as part of the offboarding process. Regular audits for old or unterminated accounts should be performed to ensure prompt deletion or disablement of accounts for terminated employees. Exit interviews can be powerful tools for gathering information when people leave an organization.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onboarding and offboarding business procedures should be well documented to ensure compliance with legal requirements.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec805">User Training</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>User training</em> is important to ensure that users are aware of and are following appropriate policies and procedures as part of their workplace activities. As in all personnel-related training, two elements need attention. First, retraining over time is necessary to ensure that personnel keep proper levels of knowledge. Second, as people change jobs, a reassessment of the required training basis is needed, and additional training may be required. Maintaining accurate training records of personnel is the only way this can be managed in any significant enterprise.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Gamification</h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Gamification</em> is the use of games to facilitate user training. This methodology has several interesting advantages. First, it makes rote learning of training material less boring. Second, it enables a more comprehensive situation-based approach to training, with consequences of bad decisions being shared with those taking the training. Third, it allows for group training by using people’s job functions in a manner that facilitates both learning and auditing of the policies and procedures in a non-threatening environment.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><span id="page_601" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Capture the Flag</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>capture-the-flag</em> event is hands-on computer skill training where a user is tested to see if they can perform specific actions. Should they perform the actions correctly, they will uncover a flag that shows they have completed the test successfully. Many hacking competitions are variations of capture-the-flag events.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Phishing Campaigns</h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Phishing campaigns</em> are a series of connected phishing attacks against an organization. Since phishing is an operational method of social engineering, the greater the level of institutional, organizational, and personal knowledge one possesses about their target, the greater the chance of success. Phishing campaigns use this common knowledge to increase their odds, rather than just randomly attacking targets. This is why internal communications concerning phishing attempts are important, to alert other users that the system may be under attack and that a heightened sense of awareness towards this form of attack is warranted.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Phishing Simulations</h5>
<p class="noindent">To help users learn and identify phishing attacks, there are methods of running <em>phishing simulations</em> against users. A phishing attempt is sent to a user, and should they fall prey to it, the system notifies the user that this was only a drill and that they should be more cautious. This also creates a teachable moment where the user can receive training detailing exactly why they should have spotted the phishing attempt.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Computer-Based Training (CBT)</h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Computer-based training (CBT)</em> is the use of a computer program to manage training of users. Self-paced modules can facilitate skill development across a wide range of skills, and the flexibility of CBT is very attractive. Not all learners learn well under these circumstances, but for those who do, CBT provides a very affordable, scalable training methodology.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Role-Based Training</h5>
<p class="noindent">For training to be effective, it needs to be targeted to the user with regard to their role in the subject of the training. While all employees may need general security awareness training, they also need specific <em>role-based awareness training</em> in areas where they have individual responsibilities. Role-based training with regard to information security responsibilities is an important part of information security training.</p>
<p class="indent">If a person has job responsibilities that may impact information security, then role-specific training is needed to ensure that the individual understands the responsibilities as they relate to information security. Some roles, such as system administrator or developer, have clearly defined information security responsibilities. The roles of others, such as project manager or purchasing manager, have information security impacts that are less obvious, but these roles require training as well. In fact, the less-obvious but wider-impact roles of middle management can have a large effect on the information security culture, and thus if a specific outcome is desired, it requires training.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="page_602" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Be sure you are familiar with the various user training methods and how they play a role in organizational security.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev314">Diversity of Training Techniques</h3>
<p class="noindent">Not all learners learn in the same fashion; some people learn by seeing, some people learn better by hearing. Almost everyone learns better by doing, but in some areas, doing a task is not practical or feasible. The bottom line is that there is a wide range of methods of training, and for the best results it is important to match the training methods to the material for the best outcome. In the previous section, several different training methods were covered, including gamification, capture-the-flag exercises, and simulations. There are even more methods to round out a wide diversity of training solutions, including in-person lectures, online content, and practice-based skill development. The key is to match the material to the method and to the learners, and then test outcomes to ensure successful training has been achieved.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev315">Third-Party Risk Management</h3>
<p class="noindent">Every business will have third parties associated with their business operations. Whether these third parties are vendors, suppliers, or business partners, they bring the opportunity for both risk and reward. <em>Third-party risk management</em> is a fairly straightforward process. The first step is to recognize that risks are present. You need to inventory and assess these risks and then develop the mitigations necessary to keep them in an acceptable range. The important concept is that risk does not magically vanish because a third party is involved; it still needs to be managed like all other business risks.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec806">Vendors</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Vendors</em> are firms or individuals that supply materials or services to a business. These items are purchased as part of a business process and represent some form of a value proposition for the firm purchasing them. But with the value can also come risk. For instance, if an item has embedded code to make it operate, what if the embedded code has vulnerabilities? What if an item that is purchased for a specific purpose fails to meet its specifications? There’s a wide range of risks that can be introduced by vendors, and these need to be examined and handled in accordance with standard risk management processes.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec807">Supply Chain</h4>
<p class="noindent">A <em>supply chain</em> is a set of firms that operate together to manage the movement of goods and services between firms. If you order a part from a foreign supplier that will become part of your product being manufactured in another country, how do all the parts get to the right place for assembly, at the right time? Supply chains handle the details that make all of this happen. From transportation, to customs and other regulations, to managing schedules, these are all details that are necessary for items to go from one place to another. <span id="page_603" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>If a firm only has a single supplier, then this process is fairly simple. However, having multiple suppliers of multiple parts at different stages of your value chain that must work together is where supply chains matter. The pandemic of 2020 illustrated this clearly, as countries closed borders, firms had difficulty operating, factories closed due to sick workers and stay-at-home orders—and none of this was uniform or occurred during the same time period. Global supply chain disruptions caused follow-on effects, where expected parts were delayed because unrelated parts elsewhere were delayed, thus interrupting different supply chains. The need to understand and manage the risks of supply chain functions and their true costs became very evident. It became clear that with extensive supply chain management, lower costs could be achieved, but at the risk of failure when the supply chain had issues.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec808">Business Partners</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Business partners</em> are entities that share a relationship with a firm in their business pursuits. Business partners can be enrolled in a business effort for multiple reasons: to share risk, share liability, share costs, leverage specialty expertise, and more. The key to understanding and navigating business partners with respect to cybersecurity and risk is to ensure that the risks and responsibilities on both partners are understood and agreed to before the risk event occurs. With every partnership comes risk and reward; the key is in understanding the level of each and making business decisions with a clear understanding of these elements.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec809">Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h4>
<p class="noindent">A <em>service level agreement (SLA)</em> is a negotiated agreement between parties detailing the expectations between a customer and a service provider. SLAs essentially set the requisite level of performance of a given contractual service. SLAs are typically included as part of a service contract and set the level of technical expectations. An SLA can define specific services, the performance level associated with a service, issue management and resolution, and so on. SLAs are negotiated between customer and supplier and represent the agreed-upon terms. Specific security requirements can be specified in an SLA and enforced once both parties agree. Once entered into, the SLA becomes a legally binding document.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec810">Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)</h4>
<p class="noindent">A <em>memorandum of understanding (MOU)</em> and memorandum of agreement (MOA) are legal documents used to describe a bilateral agreement between parties. They are written agreements that express a set of intended actions between the parties with respect to some common pursuit or goal. Typically, an MOU has higher-level descriptions, whereas an MOA is more specific; however, the boundary between these two legal terms is blurry and they are often used interchangeably. Both are more formal and detailed than a simple handshake, but they generally lack the binding powers of a contract. MOUs/MOAs are also commonly used between different units within an organization to detail expectations associated with the common business interest, including security requirements.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec811"><span id="page_604" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Many security risk management processes rely on measuring things or events. Measurements and measurement systems have to be calibrated to ensure they are evaluating the actual object of interest. <em>Measurement systems analysis (MSA)</em> is a field of study that examines measurement systems for accuracy and precision. Before an enterprise relies on measurement systems, it is important to understand whether the chosen measurement system is acceptable for its intended use, to understand the different sources of variation present in it and to identify and understand sources of bias, errors, and factors associated with repeatability and reproducibility. Performing a measurement systems analysis on the measurement systems employed in a security system is the structured process to get to that information and have confidence in the measures developed and used from the system.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec812">Business Partnership Agreement (BPA)</h4>
<p class="noindent">A <em>business partnership agreement (BPA)</em> is a legal agreement between partners that establishes the terms, conditions, and expectations of the relationship between the partners. These details can cover a wide range of issues, including typical items such as the sharing of profits and losses, the responsibilities of each partner, the addition or removal of partners, and any other issues. The Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), established by state law and convention, lays out a uniform set of rules associated with partnerships to resolve any partnership terms. The terms in a UPA are designed as “one size fits all” and are not typically in the best interest of any specific partnership. To avoid undesired outcomes that may result from UPA terms, it is best for partnerships to spell out specifics in a BPA.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure you understand the differences between the interoperability agreements SLA, BPA, and MOU/MOA for the CompTIA Security+ exam. All of them can be used to communicate security requirements between parties, but each is specific as to when it should be used. Look at usage for hints as to which would apply.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec813">End of Life (EOL)</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>End of Life (EOL)</em> or end of support is when the manufacturer quits selling an item. In most cases, the manufacturer no longer provides maintenance services or updates. In some cases, this date is announced to be a future date, after which support ends. When something enters the EOL phase, it is at the end of its lifecycle and upgrade/replacement needs to be planned and executed. When a product enters EOL phase, security patches may or may not be still produced and distributed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec814">End of Service Life (EOSL)</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>End of service life (EOSL)</em> is the term used to denote that something has reached the end of its “useful life.” When EOSL occurs, the provider of the item or service will typically no longer sell or update it. Sometimes the end of updates will be a specified date in the future. EOSL typically occurs because newer models have been released, replacing the <span id="page_605" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>older model. During the EOSL phase, some manufacturers may still offer maintenance options, but usually at a premium price. Old versions of software have had this issue, where critical systems cannot easily be upgraded and instead have contracts with the original vendor to maintain the system past its normal EOSL.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be confused! End of Life (EOL) is the term used to denote that something has reached the end of its “useful life.” End of service life (EOSL) or end of support is when the manufacturer quits selling an item. In most cases, the manufacturer no longer provides maintenance services or updates.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec815">NDA</h4>
<p class="noindent">Nondisclosure agreements were covered previously in this chapter, and they work in the same fashion with respect to third parties. Whenever information is shared with a party, inside or outside the company, if the sharing entity wishes to have contractual terms to limit sharing or disclosure, an NDA is used.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev316">Data</h3>
<p class="noindent">System integration with internal and third parties frequently involves the sharing of data. Data can be shared for the purpose of processing or storage. Control over data is a significant issue in third-party relationships. Numerous questions need to be addressed. For example, the question of who owns the data—both the data shared with third parties and subsequent data developed as part of the relationship—is an issue that needs to be established.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec816">Classification</h4>
<p class="noindent">A key component of IT security is the protection of the information processed and stored on the computer systems and network. Organizations deal with many different types of information, and they need to recognize that not all information is of equal importance or sensitivity. This requires classification of information into various categories, each with its own requirements for its handling. Factors that affect the classification of specific information include its value to the organization (what will be the impact to the organization if this information is lost?), its age, and laws or regulations that govern its protection. Data classification is covered in detail in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch35.xhtml#ch35">Chapter 35</a>, “Privacy.”</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec817">Governance</h4>
<p class="noindent">Data <em>governance</em> is the process of managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data in enterprise systems. This must be done by policy, as it involves a large number of data owners and users. Data governance should have established data standards and policies that control data usage, security, and retention. Effective governance ensures that data usage is consistent with policies, that data elements are trustworthy, and the data doesn’t get misused. The roles and responsibilities of those involved in data governance are covered in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch35.xhtml#ch35">Chapter 35</a>, “Privacy.”</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec818"><span id="page_606" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Retention</h4>
<p class="noindent">Data <em>retention</em> is the management of the data lifecycle with an emphasis on when data reaches its end of useful life for an organization. Maintaining old, excess data that no longer serves a business purpose only represents system risk, and thus should be removed from the system and properly destroyed. Having a coordinated data retention policy is more than just labeling how long different types of data should be stored. Some types of data, financial records, tax records, and so on have specific regulatory requirements as to how long they must be maintained. The retention policy must also take into account things like litigation holds on specific data elements, suspending the destruction of those elements, and other regulatory concerns. Developing a data retention policy is relatively easy, but implementing it in an efficient and effective manner can be significantly more challenging given the diverse nature of data across the enterprise and the challenge presented by item-specific litigation holds.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="lev317">Credential Policies</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Credential policies</em> refer to the processes, services, and software used to store, manage, and log the use of user credentials. User-based credential management solutions are typically aimed at assisting end users in managing their growing set of passwords. There are credential management products that provide a secure means of storing user credentials and making them available across a wide range of platforms, from local stores to cloud storage locations. System credential management solutions offer the same advantages to system owners, providing a means to manage who is given access to differing resources across the enterprise.</p>
<p class="indent">The key method used to control access to most systems is still one based on passwords. In conjunction with a strongly enforced account policy that prohibits sharing of passwords and credentials, use of passwords forms the foundation to support the concept that each user ID should be traceable to a single person’s activity. Passwords need to be managed to provide appropriate levels of protection. They need to be strong enough to resist attack, and yet not too difficult for users to remember. An account policy can act to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to enact a secure password solution, both by users and by the password infrastructure system.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec819">Personnel</h4>
<p class="noindent">Users, or <em>personnel,</em> require credentials to access specific system resources as part of their job duties. Management of who gets what credentials is part of the access and authorization management system and should be managed via a credential policy. The details behind credentials and policies for access control are covered in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch24.xhtml#ch24">Chapter 24</a>, “Implement Authentication and Authorization.”</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec820"><span id="page_607" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Third Party</h4>
<p class="noindent">Just as users inside a firm require credentials to access systems, there are situations where third parties also require credentials. Whether credentials for a system or physical access, <em>third-party</em> credentials should be managed by policies to ensure they are issued when needed to the correct parties, and when access is no longer needed, they are revoked appropriately.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec821">Devices</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Devices</em> are physical items that require access to a network or enterprise system. To have this access, they require credentials just like human users. Unlike human users, devices do not have the ability to change their password, so they are typically enabled with very long passwords to prevent hacking and have longer-than-normal password expiration periods. This makes device accounts natural targets for attackers; while their long passwords may not be crackable, they can be stolen. Device accounts should be controlled by policy and monitored as to scope of use.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec822">Service Accounts</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Service accounts</em> are special accounts that are used to provision permissions for service, or non-human-initiated system activity. Many computer systems have automated services that function as either part of, in addition to, the operating system to enable certain functionalities. These special programs require permissions like all programs that operate, and service accounts are the mechanism used to enable these items to run. Service accounts require auditing and oversight because they run in the background and frequently have significant capabilities. The enterprise needs a policy to determine who can enable and operate these accounts as well as their audit functions.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because device and service accounts do not have human operators using them, their passwords have special properties, including very long expiration periods. This makes them more susceptible to abuse, so their scope and usage should be monitored.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec823">Administrator/Root Accounts</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Administrator</em> and <em>root accounts</em> have elevated privileges and require closer scrutiny as to who is issued these credentials and how they are used and monitored. Detailed information concerning the additional safeguards needed for these accounts is detailed in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch24.xhtml#ch24">Chapter 24</a>, “Implement Authentication and Authorization.”</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev318">Organizational Policies</h3>
<p class="noindent">The important parts of any organization’s approach to implementing security include the policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines that are established to detail what users and administrators should be doing to maintain the security of the systems and network. Collectively, these documents provide the guidance needed to determine how security <span id="page_608" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>will be implemented in the organization. Given this guidance, the specific technology and security mechanisms required can be planned for.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Policies</em> are high-level, broad statements of what the organization wants to accomplish. They are made by management when laying out the organization’s position on some issue. Procedures are the step-by-step instructions on how to implement policies in the organization. They describe exactly how employees are expected to act in a given situation or to accomplish a specific task. Standards are mandatory elements regarding the implementation of a policy. They are accepted specifications that provide specific details on how a policy is to be enforced. Some standards are externally driven. Regulations for banking and financial institutions, for example, require certain security measures be taken by law. Other standards may be set by the organization to meet its own security goals. Guidelines are recommendations relating to a policy. The key term in this case is <em>recommendations</em>—guidelines are not mandatory steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec824">Change Management</h4>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of <em>change management</em> is to ensure proper procedures are followed when modifications to the IT infrastructure are made. These modifications can be prompted by a number of different events, including new legislation, updated versions of software or hardware, implementation of new software or hardware, and improvements to the infrastructure. The term <em>management</em> implies that this process should be controlled in some systematic way, and that is indeed the purpose. Changes to the infrastructure might have a detrimental impact on operations. New versions of operating systems or application software might be incompatible with other software or hardware the organization is using. Without a process to manage the change, an organization might suddenly find itself unable to conduct business. A change management process should include various stages, including a method to request a change to the infrastructure, a review and approval process for the request, an examination of the consequences of the change, resolution (or mitigation) of any detrimental effects the change might incur, implementation of the change, and documentation of the process as it related to the change.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec825">Change Control</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Change control</em> is the process of how changes to anything are sourced, analyzed, and managed. Change control is a subset of change management, focused on the details of a change and how it is documented.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change management is about the process of applying change. Change control is about the details of the change itself.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec826">Asset Management</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Asset management</em> is the policies and processes used to manage the elements of the system, including hardware, software, and the data that is contained within them. In order to secure a system, one must have some form of control over these <span id="page_609" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>assets, and asset management involves the processes employed to keep the enterprise in positive control over these valuable items. Failure to control hardware can result in rogue network devices or computers accessing systems. Failure to control software can result in system-level vulnerabilities granting attackers free reign over a system and its data. Failure to control the data assets can result in many forms of failure. This makes asset management one of the most important aspects of security, and it is ranked at the top of virtually every standard list of controls.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev319">Chapter Review</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you became acquainted with the importance of policies to organizational security. The chapter opened with a discussion of personnel policies. These policies include the acceptable use, job rotation, and mandatory vacation policies. Next was a discussion of separation of duties and least privilege. Other policies discussed in this section include clean desk policy, the use of background checks, nondisclosure agreements, and social media analysis. Onboarding and offboarding policies were also presented. This section on user training included the topics of gamification, capture-the-flag events, phishing campaigns and simulations, computer-based training, and role-based training. This was followed by an examination of the diversity of training techniques.</p>
<p class="indent">The chapter then examined third-party risk management policies, including those for vendors, the supply chain, and business partners. The legal documents of service level agreements, memorandum of understanding, measurement systems analysis, and business partnership agreements were presented. A discussion of end-of-life and end-of-service considerations was presented. The section finished with an examination of NDA policies related to third parties.</p>
<p class="indent">Data policies covering data classification, governance, and retention were presented. Next, an examination of credentialing policies to cover personnel, third parties, devices, and service accounts was presented.</p>
<p class="indent">The chapter wrapped up with an examination of organizational policies covering change management, change control, and asset management.</p>

<p class="alpha"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since security is often of secondary concern to people in their jobs, rotating individuals through security positions can result in a much wider understanding of the organization’s security problems.</p>
<p class="alpha"><strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It helps to maintain a high level of employee morale.</p>

<p class="alpha"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separation of duties is a principle employed in many organizations to ensure that no single individual has the ability to conduct transactions alone.</p>
<p class="alpha"><strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employing separation of duties means that the level of trust in any one individual is lessened, and the ability for any individual to cause catastrophic damage to the organization is also lessened.</p>
<p class="alpha"><strong>C.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separating duties as a security tool is a good practice, but it is possible to go overboard and break up transactions into too many pieces or require too much oversight.</p>
<p class="alpha"><strong>D.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separation of duties spreads responsibilities out over an organization so no single individual becomes the indispensable individual with all of the “keys to the kingdom” or unique knowledge about how to make everything work.</p>

<p class="alpha"><strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensitive information must not be left unsecured in the work area when the worker is not present to act as custodian.</p>
<p class="alpha"><strong>C.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even leaving the desk area and going to the bathroom can leave information exposed and subject to compromise.</p>
