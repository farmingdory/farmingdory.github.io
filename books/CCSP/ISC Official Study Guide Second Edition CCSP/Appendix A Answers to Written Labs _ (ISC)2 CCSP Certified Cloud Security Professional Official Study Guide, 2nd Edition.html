<h2><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="296" id="Page_296"></span><a id="app-sec1-0001"></a>Chapter 1: Architectural Concepts</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Cloud Security Alliance website provides a lot of helpful information. Be sure to read the Guidance v4 document and review all of the helpful resources.</li>
<li>Answers will vary. Here are some possible responses:
<ul>
<li>The business might be concerned with unauthorized disclosure due to negligence or malice on the part of the cloud provider.</li>
<li>The business may be attracted to the dramatic cost savings offered by cloud computing.</li>
<li>The business may want to transition from a cumbersome legacy environment into something more flexible and modern.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The three cloud computing service models include IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, and some of their common advantages and disadvantages include (but are not limited to) the following:
<ul>
<li><b>IaaS:</b>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> Reduced capital investment; increased redundancy for BC/DR; scalability</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Reliance on cloud provider for security; responsibility for maintaining OS and apps retained</p>
</li>
<li><b>PaaS:</b>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> Multiple OS platforms to utilize, making it particularly good for testbed and software development purposes; all the advantages of IaaS</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Reliance on cloud provider for updating OSs; responsibility for maintaining apps retained</p></li>
<li><b>SaaS:</b>
<p><b>Advantages:</b> Cloud provider is responsible for all infrastructure, OSs, and apps; all the advantages of PaaS</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Loss of all administrative control; may not have any insight into security</p>
</li></ul></li></ol>
<h2><a id="app-sec1-0002"></a>Chapter 2: Design Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Business Impact Analysis Worksheet is fairly straightforward and easy to use.</li>
<li>For this lab, I chose the marketing department, but any department or function can be analyzed.</li>
<li>For this lab, I chose the general loss of systems due to any and all possible reasons.</li>
<li>My worksheet, still in progress, looks like <a id="figureanchor-1" href="Appendix A Answers to Written Labs _ (ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide, 2nd Edition.html#figure-1">Figure A.1</a>.</li>

<h2><a id="app-sec1-0003"></a>Chapter 3: Data Classification</h2>
<ol>
<li>The NIST guidelines are helpful and easy to understand. Appendix D.1 provides a handy format that you can use for your devices.</li>
<li>Results should look like the example listed in 800-88, D.1:
<p><b>Example Statement of Cryptographic Erase Features:</b></p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><b>Make/Model/Version/Media Type:</b> Acme hard drive model abc12345 version 1+. Media type is Legacy Magnetic media.</li>
<li><b>Key Generation: </b>A DRBG is used as specified in SP 800-90, with validation [number].</li>
<li><b>Media Encryption:</b> Media is encrypted with AES -256 media encryption in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode as described in SP 800-38A. This device is FIPS 140 validated with certificate [number].</li>
<li><b>Key Level and Wrapping:</b> The media encryption key is sanitized directly during cryptographic erasure.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="298" id="Page_298"></span><b>Data Areas Addressed:</b> The device encrypts all data stored in the LBA-addressable space except for a preboot authentication and variable area and the device logs. Device log data is retained by the device following cryptographic erasure.</li>
<li><b>Key Lifecycle Management:</b> As the MEK moves between wrapped, unwrapped, and rewrapped states, the previous instance is sanitized using three inverted overwrite passes.</li>
<li><b>Key Sanitization Technique:</b> Three passes with a pattern that is inverted between passes.</li>
<li><b>Key Escrow or Injection:</b> The device does not support escrow or injection of the keys at or below the level of the sanitization operation.</li>
<li><b>Error Condition Handling:</b> If the storage device encounters a defect in a location where a key is stored, the device attempts to rewrite the location and the cryptographic erasure operation continues, reporting success to the user if the operation is otherwise successful.</li>
<li><b>Interface Clarity:</b> The device has an ATA interface and supports the ATA Sanitize Device feature set <span class="codeLabel">CRYPTO SCRAMBLE EXT</span> command and a TCG Opal interface with the ability to sanitize the device by cryptographically erasing the contents. Both of these commands apply the functionality described in this statement.</li>
</ol></li></ol>
<h2><a id="app-sec1-0004"></a>Chapter 4: Cloud Data Security</h2>
<ol>
<li>This white paper on preventing data leaks is just one of the many useful resources that ISACA provides. Be sure to explore others when you have the time.</li>
<li>An outstanding response would look something like this:
<p>According to the ISACA white paper on DLP solutions, the following operational risks might be involved in implementing DLP:</p>
<p><b>Improperly Set DLP Tools.</b> This is fairly obvious. The data owner must define the rules and categories associated with the organization's data or the DLP solution won't work in the manner intended. In fact, misconfigured DLP tools might actually harm the IT environment by adding extraneous overhead or responding to a significant amount of false positives.</p>
<p><b>Improperly Sized Network DLP Module.</b> If the DLP solution isn't correctly scoped for the organization's IT environment, it might miss a significant portion of network traffic, and data that should be prevented from leaving the organization's control might be allowed to go because the tool didn't even inspect it.</p>
<p><b>Excessive Reporting and False Positives.</b> See the first item; the rules and characteristics of suspect data have to be properly set by the data owner, and the tool has to understand the rules sufficiently to block only that data that fails instead of blocking legitimate traffic.</p>
<p><b>Conflicts with the Traditional Environment. </b>Interoperability will always be a concern for any new tool, including DLP.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="299" id="Page_299"></span><b>Changes in Process of Infrastructure That Affect DLP Ability to Function Properly.</b> The rules and identification capabilities for the DLP solution need to be updated as the environment changes; there is no “one-size-fits-all” DLP mechanism.</p>
<p><b>Improperly Placed DLP Modules.</b> See the second point; the DLP tool might miss suspect traffic if it's placed in the wrong network location to monitor that traffic.</p>
<p><b>Undetected Failure of DLP Modules.</b> Like any other toolset, if the DLP mechanisms aren't monitored and maintained properly and failure goes undetected, the organization will end up having a false sense of security.</p>
<p><b>Improperly Configured Directory Services.</b> The DLP tools can only create an accurate audit chain when there is sufficient traceability in the environment to support that effort.</p>
</li></ol>
<h2><a id="app-sec1-0005"></a>Chapter 5: Security in the Cloud</h2>
<ol>
<li>If possible, be sure to use the cloud providers' actual contracts when you do this. Discrepancies can exist between their marketing materials and contracts, and the contract is what is legally binding in the event of a later problem between you and the cloud provider.</li>
<li>Answers will vary. Be sure to record the URLs where you got the materials so you can refer back to them. Also, keep in mind that backup, pricing, and portability needs will vary from organization to organization. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="app-sec1-0006"></a>Chapter 6: Responsibilities in the Cloud</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Cloud Security Alliance's STAR program is widely used. You should be sure to fully understand STAR.</li>
<li>This is the questionnaire that registered cloud providers fill out. It includes information on how they handle various aspects of security.</li>
<li>This is an important document. It tells you a lot about how a cloud provider provides its services. Take some time to really consider what the information in this document means, particularly in the context of your organization's needs.</li>
<li>The Registry lists various cloud providers who have each registered with the CSA. </li>
<li>If you have time, it would be a good idea to download several completed questionnaires for different providers and compare them too.</li>
<li>Answers will vary. An outstanding response will look like this:
<p>I chose to review the [name of specific product] from [name of specific provider]. The following three issues came to my attention:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>This provider is charging customers for malware and vulnerability scans. These should probably be functions included with the price of the service instead of additional costs.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="300" id="Page_300"></span>The provider's response about collecting/creating metadata on its customers is vague and leaves room for doubt about what specific information it gathers on customer behavior. It says that the customer owns their virtual machines and that the provider doesn't access or collect the customer's data. Does the provider truly not have any idea how customers are using the service?</li>
<li>The provider is securing ecommerce transactions with SSL; it would be better if TLS was used instead.</li>
</ol></li></ol>
<h2><a id="app-sec1-0007"></a>Chapter 7: Cloud Application Security</h2>
<ol>
<li>Answers will vary. An outstanding response would look something like this:
<p>I use Microsoft's Office 365, an SaaS. The APIs include my browser (Mozilla's Firefox), and any plug-ins necessary to run the various 365 suite of applications; these can include some Java implementations, Microsoft's own specific plug-ins for Firefox (Microsoft Office 2010, Silverlight, and Windows Live Photo Manager), and any other multimedia APIs used for including material in Office work products (possibly including the plug-ins for Adobe Acrobat and the Widevine tools from Google). There may be other plug-ins and add-ons that Firefox uses to manipulate data while 365 is running.</p></li>
<li>The cloud software development lifecycle is extremely similar to other SDLCs. A couple of the major differences to note are the importance of inspecting secure remote access and strong authentication for development of apps that will be used in the cloud.</li>
<li>Answers will vary. The cloud application architecture includes many components. These include, but are not limited to, the following: APIs, tenant separation, cryptography, sandboxing, and application virtualization.</li>
<li>An identity management provider will be in charge of provisioning, maintaining, and deprovisioning identities on behalf of the cloud customer. This might include providing secure remote access, managing crypto keys, and federation of multiple resource providers.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="app-sec1-0008"></a>Chapter 8: Operations Elements</h2>
<ol>
<li>Answers will vary. An example might look like this:
<p>The application I am using as a theoretical sample is a database of information regarding dogs. The primary key will be each dog's RFID chip number, and all other fields will describe characteristics of the dogs, such as weight, color, owner information (including contact data such as email and home address), and so forth. The organization (data owner) is a dog food and toy manufacturer, and it uses this database for targeted marketing <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="301" id="Page_301"></span>to groups of dog owners. The organization's staff (the user base) accesses the database through web portals.</p></li>
<li>STRIDE comprises Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, and Elevation of privilege. Using this model helps you quickly identify many possible points of failure.</li>
<li>Answers will vary. An example:
<p>The database might be subject to these three kinds of threats:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tampering with Data:</b> SQL injection. A malicious user (either internal or external) might try to enter SQL commands in data fields as a means to corrupt the data or affect the overall system.</li>
<li><b>Controls:</b> Field validation should be included so that the program can detect SQL commands in data fields and not accept them.</li>
<li><b>Information Disclosure:</b> Dog owner PII. Because the owners' PII is included in the database (home addresses), the organization should be careful to reduce the likelihood of the PII being disclosed to unauthorized parties, including the organization's employees who do not have a need to know that data.</li>
<li><b>Controls:</b> Employ masking/obfuscation techniques so that unauthorized users do not see the PII content in those specific fields but instead see blank spaces or Xs.</li>
<li><b>Denial of Service:</b> DDoS. Because access to the database is via the web, a DDoS attack against the servers could hinder user access to the data.</li>
<li><b>Controls:</b> Deploy and utilize strong network security tools, such as properly configured routers, firewalls, and IDS/IPS systems, and ensure redundancy of all Internet connections (including DNS nodes).</li>
</ul>
</li></ol>
<h2><a id="app-sec1-0009"></a>Chapter 9: Operations Management</h2>
<ol>
<li>Answers will vary. Possible choices might include Kohler, Honda, Cummins, Subaru, and Hitachi.</li>
<li>Answers will vary. Be sure to compare the specifications for the generators you chose against the hypothetical loads you imagine for your data centers and against the ASHRAE standards. </li>
<li>Answers will vary. You should use the listed criteria (load, price, fuel) to justify your choice of preferred generator. The ASHRAE guidance is fairly detailed regarding specific ranges, based on the type, age, and location of the equipment. As you compare the generators, it is important to determine which guidance is most applicable to your facility and take into account any guidance and recommendations from the manufacturers regarding ambient ranges affecting performance parameters for their specific products.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" title="302" id="Page_302"></span><a id="app-sec1-0010"></a>Chapter 10: Legal and Compliance Part 1</h2>
<ol>
<li>Laws are dictated by legislatures and enforced by government. Regulations are created by governmental agencies and enforced by government. Standards are prescribed modes for certain types of activity; sources include industry bodies, certifying entities, or internal guidelines within organizations themselves. Contracts can also result in mandates, even if they are entered into voluntarily.</li>
<li>HIPAA now includes a number of rules that have been developed to address a range of issues. The two most often referred to are the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule. The Privacy Rule deals with the necessity to protect patient data (PHI), and the Security Rule deals with supporting the CIA triad in a medical organization.</li>
<li>The SOC 1 report addresses only financial reporting activity and is of no interest to IT security practitioners. The SOC 2 describes IT security controls and comes in two types, Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 covers the architecture and control framework design at a point in time, whereas Type 2 is a review of the actual controls as implemented over a period of time. The SOC 3 report is only an attestation that one of the SOC 2 reports has been performed, without any detail.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="app-sec1-0011"></a>Chapter 11: Legal and Compliance Part 2</h2>
<ol>
<li>The CSA Star program and Open Certification Framework have been widely adopted. While many cloud providers meet their requirements, not all have, so it is still important to confirm this.</li>
<li>Answers will vary and might include NIST's 800-37 (Risk Management Framework), COSO, and COBIT.</li>
<li>Answers will vary and might include throughput, per-use prices, the customer's business drivers, BC/DR considerations, portability, and more.</li>
</ol>
