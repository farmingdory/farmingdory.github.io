<p class="noindent-top">Threats are actions that can result in risk to a system. A threat actor is the source of the threat on the system. Vectors are the methods that threat actors use to attack a vulnerability in a system in order to achieve their objective. Threat intelligence is knowledge based on evidence that allows you to prevent or mitigate cyber threats.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Certification Objective</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter covers CompTIA Security+ exam objective 1.5: Explain different threat actors, vectors, and intelligence sources.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev62">Actors and Threats</h3>
<p class="noindent">The act of deliberately accessing computer systems and networks without authorization is generally referred to as <em>hacking,</em> with individuals who conduct this activity being referred to as <em>hackers.</em> The term <em>hacking</em> also applies to the act of exceeding one’s authority in a system. This would include authorized users who attempt to gain access to files they aren’t permitted to access or who attempt to obtain permissions they have not been granted. While the act of breaking into computer systems and networks has been glorified in the media and movies, the physical act does not live up to the Hollywood hype. Intruders are, if nothing else, extremely patient, since the process of gaining access to a system takes persistence and dogged determination. The attacker will conduct many pre-attack activities in order to obtain the information needed to determine which attack will most likely be successful. Typically, by the time an attack is launched, the attacker will have gathered enough information to be very confident that the attack will succeed.</p>
<p class="indent">Generally, attacks by an individual or even a small group of attackers fall into the <em>unstructured threat</em> category. Attacks at this level generally are conducted over short periods of time (lasting at most a few months), do not involve a large number of individuals, have little financial backing, and are accomplished by insiders or outsiders who do not <span id="page_78" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>seek collusion with insiders. Intruders, or those who are attempting to conduct an intrusion, definitely come in many different varieties and have varying degrees of sophistication (see <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#ch5fig1">Figure 5-1</a>).</p>

<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prepared for questions that require you to identify differences between the types of threat actors, including those listed in sections later in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec83">Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</h4>
<p class="noindent">A major advance in cyberattacks is the development of <em>advanced persistent threats (APTs)</em>. An APT attack is characterized by using toolkits to achieve a presence on a target network and then, instead of just moving to steal information, focusing on the long game by maintaining a persistent presence on the target network. The tactics, tools, and procedures of APTs are focused on maintaining administrative access to the target network and avoiding detection. Then, over the long haul, the attacker can remove intellectual property and more from the organization, typically undetected.</p>
<p class="indent">Operation Night Dragon was the name given to an intellectual property attack executed against oil, gas, and petrochemical companies in the United States in 2006. Using a set of global servers, attackers from China raided global energy companies for proprietary and highly confidential information such as bidding data for leases. The attack shed new light on what constitutes critical data and associated risks. Further, as demonstrated <span id="page_79" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>by the Stuxnet attacks against Iranian uranium plants, the cyberattacks in Estonia, and the attacks on electricity distribution in Ukraine, the risk of nation-state attacks is real. There have been numerous accusations of intellectual property theft being sponsored by, and in some cases even performed by, nation-state actors. In a world where information dominates government, business, and economies, the collection of information is the key to success, and with large rewards, the list of characters willing to spend significant resources is high.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec84">Insider Threats</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is generally acknowledged by security professionals that <em>insiders</em> are more dangerous in many respects than outside intruders. The reason for this is simple: insiders have the access and knowledge necessary to cause immediate damage to an organization. Most security is designed to protect against outside intruders and thus lies at the boundary between the organization and the rest of the world. Insiders may actually already have all the access they need to perpetrate criminal activity such as fraud. In addition to unprecedented access, insiders also frequently have knowledge of the security systems in place and are better able to avoid detection. Attacks by insiders are often the result of employees who have become disgruntled with their organization and are looking for ways to disrupt operations. It is also possible that an “attack” by an insider may be an accident and not intended as an attack at all. An example of this might be an employee who deletes a critical file without understanding its critical nature.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the hardest threats that security professionals will have to address is that of the insider. Since employees already have access to the organization and its assets, additional mechanisms need to be in place to detect attacks by insiders and to lessen the ability of these attacks to succeed.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Employees are not the only insiders who organizations need to be concerned about. Often, numerous other individuals have physical access to company facilities. Custodial crews frequently have unescorted access throughout the facility, often when nobody else is around. Other individuals, such as contractors or partners, may have not only physical access to the organization’s facilities but also access to computer systems and networks. A contractor involved in U.S. intelligence computing, Edward Snowden, was charged with espionage in 2013 after he released a wide range of data illustrating the technical capabilities of U.S. intelligence surveillance systems. He was the ultimate insider, with his name becoming synonymous with the insider threat issue.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways to protect against a skilled hacker is to prevent any individual from performing critical duties alone. The method of doing this is through separation of duties, a policy whereby critical functions require more than one person to affect the changes.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec85"><span id="page_80" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>State Actors</h4>
<p class="noindent">At the top end of the spectrum shown in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#ch5fig1">Figure 5-1</a> are those highly technical individuals, often referred to as <em>elite hackers,</em> who not only have the ability to write scripts that exploit vulnerabilities but also are capable of discovering new vulnerabilities. This group is the smallest of the lot, however, and is responsible for, at most, only 1 to 2 percent of intrusive activity. Many of these elite hackers are employed by major cybersecurity firms in an effort to combat criminal activity. Others are employed by nation-states and other international organizations, to train and run large groups of skilled hackers to conduct nation-state attacks against a wide range of adversaries. In the United States, government rules and regulations prevent government workers from attacking companies for reasons of economic warfare. Not all countries live by this principle, and many have organized hacking efforts designed to gather information from international companies, stealing intellectual property for the express purpose of advancing their own country’s national companies.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State actors are employed by governments to compromise or gain access to the intelligence data of targeted governments. They are typically well funded and often carry out APT attacks.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">As nations have increasingly become dependent on computer systems and networks, the possibility that the essential elements of society might be targeted by organizations or other nations determined to adversely affect them has become a reality. Many nations today have developed to some extent the capability to conduct <em>information warfare</em>. There are several definitions for information warfare, but a simple one is that it is warfare conducted against the information and information-processing equipment used by an adversary. In practice, this is a much more complicated subject, because information not only may be the target of an adversary, but also may be used as a weapon. Whatever definition you use, information warfare falls into the <em>highly structured threat</em> category. This type of threat is characterized by a much longer period of preparation (years is not uncommon), tremendous financial backing, and a large and organized group of attackers. The threat may include attempts not only to subvert insiders but also to plant individuals inside of a potential target in advance of a planned attack.</p>
<p class="indent">An interesting aspect of information warfare is the list of possible targets available. We have grown accustomed to the idea that, during war, military forces will target opposing military forces but will generally attempt to destroy as little civilian infrastructure as possible. In information warfare, military forces are certainly still a key target, but much has been written about other targets, such as the various infrastructures that a nation relies on for its daily existence. Water, electricity, oil and gas refineries and distribution, banking and finance, telecommunications all fall into the category of critical infrastructures for a nation. Critical infrastructures are those whose loss would have severe repercussions on the nation. With countries relying so heavily on these infrastructures, it is inevitable that they will be viewed as valid targets during conflict. Given how dependent these infrastructures are on computer systems and networks, it is also inevitable that these same computer systems and networks will be targeted for a cyberattack in an information war.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec86"><span id="page_81" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Hacktivists</h4>
<p class="noindent">As shown in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#ch5fig1">Figure 5-1</a>, at the next level below elite hackers are those people who are capable of writing scripts to exploit known vulnerabilities. These individuals are much more technically competent than script kiddies (the bottom end of the spectrum) and account for an estimated 8 to 12 percent of malicious Internet activity. When hackers work together for a collectivist effort, typically on behalf of some cause, they are referred to as <em>hacktivists</em>. Hacktivist groups may include script kiddies, but in general script kiddies do not have the skills to participate in a meaningful manner in advancing a hacktivist cause, although they may be enlisted as ground troops to add volume to an attack.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec87">Script Kiddies</h4>
<p class="noindent">At the low end of the spectrum, technically speaking, are what are generally referred to as <em>script kiddies</em>—individuals who do not have the technical expertise to develop scripts or discover new vulnerabilities in software, but who have just enough understanding of computer systems to be able to download and run scripts that others have developed. These individuals generally are not interested in attacking specific targets but instead simply want to find any organization that may not have patched a newly discovered vulnerability for which the script kiddie has located a script to exploit. It is hard to estimate how many of the individuals performing activities such as probing networks or scanning individual systems are part of this group, but it is undoubtedly the fastest growing group, and the vast majority of the “unfriendly” activity occurring on the Internet is probably carried out by these individuals.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec88">Criminal Syndicates</h4>
<p class="noindent">As businesses became increasingly reliant upon computer systems and networks, and as the amount of financial transactions conducted via the Internet increased, it was inevitable that <em>organized crime</em> would eventually turn to the electronic world as a new target to exploit. One of the major changes over the past decade in cybersecurity has been the ability for hackers to monetize their efforts. Part of this is due to the rise in cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, but an entire marketplace on the dark web exists for stolen identities, financial data, and intellectual property that, in terms of dollars, is larger than the international drug trade. This has led to a whole new class of organized crime figure, cybersecurity criminals, who can lurk in the shadows of anonymity and create malware and perform attacks, all with an eye on making money.</p>
<p class="indent">Criminal activity on the Internet at its most basic is no different from criminal activity in the physical world. Fraud, extortion, theft, embezzlement, and forgery all take place in the electronic environment.</p>
<p class="indent">One difference between criminal groups and the “average” hacker is the level of organization that criminal elements employ in their attack. Criminal groups typically have more money to spend on accomplishing the criminal activity and are willing to spend extra time accomplishing the task, provided the level of reward at the conclusion is great enough. With the tremendous amount of money that is exchanged via the Internet on a daily basis, the level of reward for a successful attack is high enough to interest criminal <span id="page_82" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>elements. Attacks by criminal organizations usually fall into the <em>structured threat</em> category, which is characterized by a greater amount of planning, a longer period of time to conduct the activity, more financial backing to accomplish it, and possibly corruption of, or collusion with, insiders.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec89">Hackers</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Hackers</em> is a loaded term, as it is used by many for different purposes. The original use of the term related to individuals who spent time trying to figure out how something worked so that they could control it in ways it wasn’t designed. This sometimes meant subverting controls, leading to unauthorized uses. Today, this group still exists. But many also use the term to describe anyone who improperly uses computers, including criminals. This has led to the descriptors authorized, unauthorized, and semi-authorized.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Authorized</h5>
<p class="noindent">Authorized individualswho use their computer “hacking” skills for good purposes have the common name “white hat” hackers. They can be security consultants chasing vulnerabilities or performing penetration tests, as well as many other security activities. The difference between a white hat and someone breaking the law is that the white hat hacker is using the same tools and techniques as the threat actors, but is doing so with permission so that a firm can learn its weaknesses and fix them.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Unauthorized</h5>
<p class="noindent">Black hat hackers are the opposite of white hats. Rather than use their skills for good, they use their skills for illegal and criminal activities. Individuals and groups that act in an unauthorized manner are violating laws and causing risk to systems. There are many different motivations behind black hat hackers, but in the end, they are performing activities that are illegal.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Semi-authorized</h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Gray hat</em> hackers live with one foot in each world. They may use their skills for good at their job as a white hat hacker, but then at other times they use the same skills illegally acting as a black hat hacker. This group of semi-authorized hackers works in both the legally sanctioned world of security and the illegal realm of criminal activity.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that white hat/authorized hackers are experts who protect systems, black hat/unauthorized hackers are criminals who hack devices and apps to steal data, and gray hat/semi-authourized hackers often violate ethics and laws, but do not always have the same malicious intent as black hat hackers.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the terms <em>black hat</em> and <em>white hat</em>? These are a throwback reference to old cowboy movies, where the good guy wore a white hat and the villain wore a black hat.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec90"><span id="page_83" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Shadow IT</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Shadow IT</em> is a name given to the parts of an organization that perform their own IT functions. These groups rise up out of a desire to “get things done” when central IT does not respond in what the unit considers to be a reasonable time frame. While this vigilante IT effort might seem helpful, because it is outside the control of the central IT function, the IT systems created are not in the same realm of protection. If you set up a wireless access point so you can move about your office untethered by a network cable, the question becomes, who keeps this network connection safe from outside threats? If a hard drive fails on a shadow IT part of the infrastructure, was it backed up correctly? How will data be recovered? Generally speaking, shadow IT is a symptom of a less that perfectly functioning central IT process and can lead to increased risk. Shadow IT can become a significant risk as its infrastructure provides inside users with increased access and connections.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec91">Competitors</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Competitors</em> can be a threat to a business on the field of battle: sales, markdowns, rival products—it is a battle for customers every day. But this is just business—legal and normal. But competitors have been known to attack other firms’ IT processes. The methods vary from simple false product reviews to more serious elements such as the actual hacking of systems. There have been several recorded cases of criminal activity on the part of one firm against another. This includes stealing intellectual property or customer lists as well as other activities such as denial-of-service attacks.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev63">Attributes of Actors</h3>
<p class="noindent">Threat actors can be divided into groups based on abilities. There are other ways to differentiate the threat actors: by location (internal or external), level of sophistication, level of resources, and intent. These attributes are described next.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec92">Internal/External</h4>
<p class="noindent">Internal threat actors have one significant advantage over external actors: they have access to the system. Although the access may be limited to the user level, it still provides the threat actor the ability to pursue their attack. External actors have an additional step to take: the establishment of access to the target system.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec93">Level of Sophistication/Capability</h4>
<p class="noindent">As shown earlier in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#ch5fig1">Figure 5-1</a>, attacker skill or sophistication can be divided into a few categories. However, within a group of threat actors, the skill level of the individual members of the group may well be mixed, with a few highly skilled individuals acting to move larger numbers of less skilled participants. The greater the skill level, the more an individual will be expected to lead and design the attacks. When it comes to the sophistication level of the attack itself, one notable trend is that as the skill level goes up, so too does the use of minimal methods. Although zero-day attacks are widely covered in <span id="page_84" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>the news, true zero-day vulnerabilities are rarely used; they are reserved for the few cases where there are no other options, because once these they vulnerabilities are exploited, they will be patched. Even with highly sophisticated and resourced nation-state teams employing APT methods, a surprising number of attacks are old attacks, exploit old vulnerabilities, and use simple methods that take advantage of “low-hanging fruit.” This is not to say that newer, more advanced methods are not used, but rather there is an economy of mechanism in the attacks themselves, using just what is needed at each step. There is also a lot of data missing in this scenario, as we do not know of the methods that have been used successfully if the threat actor remains undetected.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec94">Resources/Funding</h4>
<p class="noindent">As mentioned earlier, criminal organizations and nation-states have larger budgets, bigger teams, and the ability to pursue campaigns for longer periods of time. Cybersecurity is challenging for attackers as well as defenders, and there are expenses associated with maintaining teams and tools used by threat actors against a system. APTs, with their penchant for long-term attacks, some lasting for years, require significant resources to engage in this type of activity, so there is a need for long-term resources that only major organizations or governments can manage over time.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec95">Intent/Motivation</h4>
<p class="noindent">The intent or motivation behind an attack can be simple or multifold in nature. A script kiddie is just trying to make a technique work. A more skilled threat actor is usually pursuing a specific objective, such as trying to make a point as a hacktivist. At the top of the intent pyramid is the APT threat actor, whose intent or motivation is at least threefold: First is the drive to maintain continual access. Second is the drive to remain undetected. In most APTs that are discovered, the length of intrusion is greater than a year and in many cases determining the original date of infection is not possible, as it is limited by the length of logs. Third is the goal of stealing something of value on the network. APTs do not go to all the trouble of maintaining access and remaining invisible just to crash a system or force a rebuild.</p>

<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security+ exam will describe threat actors in terms of attributes: resources, level of sophistication, location, and motivation. Be sure to understand how these differences matter with respect to the types of attacks.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev64">Vectors</h3>
<p class="noindent">Threats are perpetuated by threat actors, and they use various vectors to exploit vulnerabilities in a system, giving them unauthorized access. <em>Vectors</em> is the term for the various methods that an attacker can use to get in—whether it is direct access via wireless or e-mail channels, social media, supply chain, an external data source such as removable media, or the cloud. The bottom line is, if there is a way to move data into your system, this can be a potential vector for attackers to use, so you must take appropriate safeguards.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><span id="page_85" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prepared for questions that require you to identify differences between the types of threat vectors.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec96">Direct Access</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Direct access</em> is just that: the attacker has direct access to the system. This can be an insider attack, or perhaps outsiders are given the ability to interact directly with the systems, such as web servers. Direct access is why we need to use the principle of least privilege, only giving the necessary permissions and blocking all others. In the case of an outsider being granted permission to use a system (say, to create pages on the site), it is imperative that all outside input is treated as dangerous until proven otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec97">Wireless</h4>
<p class="noindent">Wireless networks bring much in the way of networking simplicity. But with this ease of connecting machines comes a whole host of security issues. For details on the issues of overall wireless security, see <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch20.xhtml#ch20">Chapter 20</a>. With respect to attack vectors, <em>wireless</em> access brings a host of new opportunities. No longer does the attacker have to have direct physical access to the network—a wireless signal can bring it to the attacker, who may only have to sit in the parking lot to perform their attack.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec98">E-mail</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>E-mail</em> is one of the preferred vectors for social engineering attacks. Sending an e-mail that includes links or attachments is a manner of interacting with a user. If a convincing message is included, users may click on the links or open the attachment, and the vector has done its job—delivering the payload.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec99">Supply Chain</h4>
<p class="noindent">A <em>supply chain</em> vector involves using a company’s supply chain as an unwitting agent in the attack. There are numerous forms of attacks that can be delivered in this fashion, and several are covered in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch1.xhtml#ch1">Chapters 1</a> and <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch33.xhtml#ch33">33</a>. The concept is relatively simple: an attacker finds a means by which they can get their attack code into the supply chain for a product or an update—for example, attacking a vendor and leaving the code on a program used to test storage hardware, thus leaving the bad code on new storage device, or attacking the update mechanism by poisoning one of the update files that is distributed via the web. Firms tend to trust their vendors and may skip security checks such as validating downloads with hashes. This is an area where Microsoft has excelled: its update process has numerous security checks, making it virtually impossible to poison one of the company’s updates.</p>
<p class="indent">In December 2020, a popular centralized management software package, Solar Winds Orion, was discovered to have been breached by a nation-state actor. This breach into the product chain went unnoticed for nine months, spreading across the top corporations and government agencies. The list of breached firms will not be known until sometime in 2021, but the biggest names in tech, Microsoft, Cisco, FireEye, and major <span id="page_86" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>US government agencies, have already begun dealing with the damage. The attack, using the supply chain of a commonly used tool suite, was sophisticated and remarkably advanced, remaining in the shadows for months. Supply chain attacks are a real threat and one that can’t be stopped just by policy and contracts.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec100">Social Media</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Social media</em> can be a vector for social engineering attacks because it connects an attacker directly to a user, and many of the security checks seen with corporate e-mail and other communication channels are not present. By sending a shortened URL, the attacker can often get people to click on it, and then with crafty redirection, bad things can happen prior to the desired GIF showing up, and the user is never the wiser of the payload that was delivered. Social media–based social engineering attacks are covered in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec101">Removable Media</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Removable media</em>, typically in the form of USB memory sticks, represents a clear threat vector. This type of storage is small, ubiquitous, and takes no skill to attach to a PC. How this becomes a threat is driven by social engineering. An attacker takes a USB storage device and puts the attacking module on it so that it can be executed. Then, the trick is to get someone to interact with the file. Placing the USB device in a location prone to discovery leads to an attack referred to as a “USB drop attack” (see <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a>). As with all behavioral attacks, user education is needed (in this case, users should be taught not to touch “abandoned” USB drives). They should view USB storage devices as “dog poop” and avoid picking them up and using them. You can also employ USB blockers and disable AutoPlay (which may be enabled by default) for USB and removable media. These system-level protections may make a lot of sense in specific machines such as kiosks or those machines exposed to the public.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec102">Cloud</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>cloud</em> is another attack vector. If you are connected to the cloud, it will be for business purposes, and therefore you will have some form of trust in it. But if you view the cloud, and especially cloud storage, as just someone else’s computer, you can see the vector. If your cloud agreement does not include antivirus protections on files, then it is really no different from any other Internet-connected source.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev65">Threat Intelligence Sources</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cybersecurity is a game of resource management. No firm has the resources to protect everything against all threats, and even attempting to do so would add complexity that would open up other threat avenues. One of the important decisions to be made is where to apply one’s resources in the complex landscape of cybersecurity defense. Threat intelligence is the gathering of information from a variety of sources, including nonpublic sources, to allow an entity to properly focus its defenses against the most likely threat actors. <em>Threat intelligence sources</em> are the places where one can get this information, and <span id="page_87" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>there is a wide range of them—from open source, to proprietary, to specialized sources. These are covered in the following sessions.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prepared for questions that require you to identify the differences between the types of threat intelligence sources.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec103">Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Open source intelligence</em>, sometimes called <em>open source threat intelligence</em>, refers to intelligence data collected from public sources. There is a wide range of public sources of information concerning current cybersecurity activity. From news articles, to blogs, to government reports, there seems to be a never-ending stream of news concerning what is happening, to whom, and how. The challenge is in collating the information into a usable format, which is a need that open source intelligence feeds fill.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a wide range of open source feeds, and each can add value, but the important question for each feed is where its information comes from, how vetted the information is, and how up to date the collection is. Here is a list of several sources and basic answers to these questions:</p>
<p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Automated Indicator Sharing is a collection of information such as malicious e-mail addresses, IP addresses, and other bad material reported by private companies to the DHS via its Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) portal. This list is curated, and depends on firms contributing to it to keep it up to date and comprehensive.</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;InfraGard Portal is a vetted access collection of security information reported to the FBI. It tends to focus on critical infrastructure and can have significant time lags, as the FBI holds information involved in investigations.</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>SANS</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet Storm Center (ISC) is a distributed sensor network that processes over 20 million intrusion detection log entries per day and generates alerts concerning security threats.</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>VirusTotal</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now operated by Google, VirusTotal uses feeds from a myriad of antivirus scanners to maintain a signature database of malware and related information.</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cisco</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Talos Intelligence team produces a feed of information for Cisco customers (a free version is also available). The breadth of Cisco’s collection and the depth of its research team makes this an important feed for new and emerging dangers.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec104">Closed/Proprietary</h4>
<p class="noindent">The threat intelligence marketplace is filled with security firms offering threat intelligence products. One of their primary offerings is access to their <em>closed</em> or <em>proprietary</em> threat intelligence database. In evaluating these offerings, one of the key factors is the <span id="page_88" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>number and diversity of data feeds. What is the source of their data and what characteristics do they have with respect to the data in their database? Most firms will offer an automatable file format feed from their data structures to provide information to security tools from their data. Common formats include CSV, XML, JSON, and STIX. STIX (the Structured Threat Information Expression format) is specifically covered later in this chapter. Other important factors include things such as how often the data is updated and what industries are the focus of the data. The industry question is important because, although at one level all IT systems face the same sea of vulnerabilities, threat actors have patterns and they tend to operate by industry, making industry exposures different from one to the next.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec105">Vulnerability Databases</h4>
<p class="noindent">Vulnerabilities are the weaknesses in software that allow an attacker a means of entry. You need to know what is vulnerable and either patch the vulnerability or provide a defensive solution to prevent the vulnerability from being exposed to an attacker. Knowing what vulnerabilities exist in software is a challenge. Because there are so many pieces of software and so many vulnerabilities, this is a data problem that needs a database to catalog and maintain. And there are <em>vulnerability databases</em>—and not one but several. For example, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) hosted at nvd.nist.gov is a repository of vulnerabilities and related information such as security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.</p>
<p class="indent">There have been other attempts at creating vulnerability databases, including the long-running Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB), which ran from 2004 until 2016, when it became a subscription model. Most of the vulnerability databases marketed by security firms are modified from the NVD. One major exception is the Metasploit vulnerability database, which is a curated repository of vetted exploits to vulnerabilities that are used in the Metasploit framework.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec106">Public/Private Information Sharing Centers</h4>
<p class="noindent">In the realm of <em>public/private information sharing centers</em> are Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs). ISAOs vary greatly in capability but essentially include any organization, whether an industry sector or geographic region, that is sharing cyber-related information for the purpose of enhancing their members’ cybersecurity posture. ISACs are a special category of ISAO consisting of privately run, but government approved, industry-based cybersecurity. ISACs may be considered fusion centers where real-time information can be shared between members. ISAOs and ISACs work on a very simple premise: share what is happening to you, and together learn what is happening in your industry. The sharing is anonymized, the analysis is performed by highly skilled workers in a security operations center, and the resulting information is fed back to members as close to real time as possible. Highly skilled analysts are expensive, and this mechanism shares the costs across all of the member institutions.</p>
<p class="indent">A U.S. government program, InfraGard, is run by the FBI and also acts as a means of sharing, although timeliness and level of analysis are nowhere near that of an ISAC, but the price is right (free).</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec107"><span id="page_89" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Dark Web</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>dark web</em> is a subset of the worldwide content on the Internet that has its access restricted via specific obfuscation methods. Dark web sites are sites that require Tor—a free, open source software that enables anonymous communication. Because the dark web exists only in the realm of onion routing, dark web sites end with .onion, as opposed to .com, .net, and so on. When a browser is on the dark web, because of the onion routing protocol, the access is anonymous. This has made the dark web a haven for criminal activity, and one can find a lot of illegal items there—from stolen information to illicit substances.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an area of the Internet called the deep web, which is the part of the Internet that is not indexed by search engines. One example of the deep web is material that requires you to log in to an account before it is exposed. Yes, the deep web is readily accessible to a browser, but only with specific information, such as a login to get there. This is different from the dark web. So, while some may use the terms interchangeably, there is a difference between the deep web and dark web.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec108">Indicators of Compromise</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Indicators of compromise (IoCs)</em> are just as the name suggests: indications that a system has been compromised by unauthorized activity. When a threat actor makes changes to a system, either by direct action, malware, or other exploit, forensic artifacts are left behind in the system. IoCs act as breadcrumbs for investigators, providing little clues that can help identify the presence of an attack on a system. The challenge is in looking for, collecting, and analyzing these bits of information and then determining what they mean for a given system. This is one of the primary tasks for an incident responder: gathering and processing these disparate pieces of data and creating a meaningful picture of the current state of a system.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, there are toolsets to aid the investigator in this task. Tools such as YARA can take a set of signatures (also called IoCs) and then scan a system for them, determining whether or not a specific threshold is met indicating a particular infection. Although the specific list will vary based on the system and the specific threat that one is looking for, a common set of IoCs that firms should monitor include the following:</p>
<p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unusual outbound network traffic</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anomalies in privileged user account activity</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographical irregularities in network traffic</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Account login red flags</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases in database read volumes</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML response sizes</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large numbers of requests for the same file</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="page_90" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Mismatched port-application traffic, including encrypted traffic on plain ports</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspicious registry or system file changes</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unusual DNS requests</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected patching of systems</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile device profile changes</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bundles of data in the wrong place</p>
<p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web traffic with nonhuman behavior</p>
<p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signs of DDoS activity, even if temporary</p>
<p class="indent">No single compromise will exhibit everything on this list, but monitoring these items will tend to catch most compromises, because at some point in the compromise lifecycle, every compromise will exhibit one or more of the preceding behaviors. Then, once a compromise is detected, the responder can zero in on the information and fully document the nature and scope of the problem.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that typical indicators of compromise may include virus signatures, domain names or URLs of botnet servers, and MD5 hashes of malware.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec109">Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Created by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, <em>Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)</em> is an automated, bidirectional cyber-threat indicator method that’s used for reporting. A key element of AIS is that it operates at machine speed, permitting near-real-time reporting and response. Firms must sign up to join this effort, and once they agree to anonymized information sharing, their connection is established. The goal of the AIS program is to commoditize collection of threat intelligence information to enable everyone access to feeds of cyber threats. The AIS system uses the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) and Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) specifications to enable machine-to-machine communication at machine speed. Participants in AIS must be able to produce and consume these protocols.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec110">Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) / Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)</h4>
<p class="noindent">To communicate cyber-threat information at machine speed, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security initiated the STIX/TAXII (Structured Threat Information Expression / Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information) program in 2012. Now governed by the international consensus body OASIS, both STIX and TAXII provide a set of community-driven standards that enable the automated exchange of information associated with cyber threats, network defense, and threat analysis. STIX is a <span id="page_91" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>standardized, machine-readable (yet also human-readable) structured language to represent cyber-threat information. TAXII defines a set of services and message exchanges that enable the automated sharing of actionable cyber-threat information across organizational, product line, and service boundaries. TAXII represents the transport method, and STIX represents the message.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that STIX represents the cyber-threat information (threat intelligence) while TAXII defines how the information is exchanged. You can think of TAXII as “how you get there.”</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec111">Predictive Analysis</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Predictive analysis</em> is the use of threat intelligence information to anticipate the next move of a threat. Typically this is done by curating large quantities of data from multiple sources and sifting through this sea of data to find the key pieces of information that are necessary to put together a hypothesis about what threats are potentially up to and determine how to find them in your enterprise. As each industry has different threat actors, and each set of threat actors tends to use specific methods, this effort works best when tailored to the specifics of an industry. It can also be useful in examining new threats that emerge because of some specific factor, such as negative press surrounding your firm, making it a target for a variety of hacktivists.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec112">Threat Maps</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Threat maps</em> are geographical representations of attacks showing where packets are coming from and going to, as shown in <a href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#ch5fig2">Figure 5-2</a>. These gain a lot of media attention and are nice to look at, but one must approach them with caution. Attribution is difficult, and just because an attack comes from an IP in a certain city does not mean the attack actually originated from there. The machine that is attacking you may well be a victim, with the attacker working from somewhere else to make investigations across borders more difficult and expensive.</p>

<p class="hr-f"></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong>Figure 5-2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Threat map example</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec113">File/Code Repositories</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the major areas of growth in software development over the past decade has been <em>file/code repositories</em>. Repositories such as GitHub act as locations where people can work together on projects and develop software. These repositories can play two distinct roles in threat intelligence. First, they can offer a source of information to adversaries about how software is built, giving them a chance to examine the source code for vulnerabilities. If your organization uses code from a repository and you make it known to the world (typically because one of your employees is a contributor), then you are providing adversaries information about your infrastructure that could be used against you. Second, you can use the same sources to examine the capabilities of some of the tools your adversaries will use against you. Therefore, code repositories are neither good nor bad with respect to threat intelligence; rather, they are a source for both sides of the equation.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><span id="page_92" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><img class="inline" src="./public/note.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="65"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you develop software in house, maintaining a repository of where all the modules came from, including versions, is important for tracing issues. This is called a software bill of material (software BOM) and is important when you learn of vulnerabilities in code you are reusing.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev66">Research Sources</h3>
<p class="noindent">When someone wants to research a topic, one of the challenges is finding sources of information that are vetted for veracity. Threat intelligence is no different. There are a wide range of sources, from vendors to local industry groups, from vulnerability feeds to threat feeds, from conferences to academic journals to requests for comment (RFCs) entries. These and more will be reviewed in this section, but note that each has strengths and weaknesses, which can be critical, so a good mix of sources is important to employ.</p>
<div class="sidebarn">
<p class="notei"><img class="inline" src="./public/exam.jpg" alt="Images" width="70" height="57"></p>
<p class="note"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prepared for questions that require you to identify differences between the types of threat research sources.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec114"><span id="page_93" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Vendor Websites</h4>
<p class="noindent">Every vendor wants to be a valued partner in your security problem and share in your budget. To get there, they have marketing teams that develop nice-looking websites. These <em>vendor websites</em> appear to be teeming with information—information designed to make you want to partner with them. But remember, this is just marketing—you need to find out what their sources are, how they are curated, and what standards they use. This is not saying that the material is bad, just that the old axiom <em>caveat emptor</em> applies.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec115">Vulnerability Feeds</h4>
<p class="noindent">As mentioned in the previous section, the quality of vulnerability feeds can vary greatly from one source to another. To ensure you have good sources, it is important to vet your feeds for a variety of issues, including what the source of the data is and what specific characteristics are presented as part of the feed. Additionally, multiple feeds are almost mandatory for coverage, but that also means you need to compare the items between the feeds because two sets of feeds with a single common source (say, the NVD) do not actually provide more value. Using multiple feeds, with different sources and characteristics, consolidated to a single database is the path to better coverage.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec116">Conferences</h4>
<p class="noindent">Academics perform research, and when the research has a timeliness component, then waiting for a journal article (covered in the next section) is a problem. The solution to this problem is publishing the material and presenting it at a conference. This has two advantages: First, the timelines for conference submissions are much shorter than journals. Second, the presentation of the material at the conference is a good way to get multiple points of view in the form of feedback in a quicker fashion. The downside is that until this feedback is considered and vetted, most conference papers have little serious peer review, so they need to be treated with an open eye toward accuracy and applicability.</p>
<p class="indent">Another source is industry conferences, which provide the chance for people from various companies to come together to share information on a series of related topics. Sometimes sponsored by governments or industry trade groups, the main advantage of attending these conferences is not the sessions, because the content is frequently available elsewhere afterwards, but rather the in-person networking. Three major security conferences are held each year: the RSA conference in San Francisco and the Black Hat USA and DEF CON conferences in Las Vegas. Although each has a slightly different audience, they all number in the tens of thousands of attendees. The primary reason professionals attend these shows is to network with other professionals and to learn new and useful methods they can apply after the event.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec117">Academic Journals</h4>
<p class="noindent">A major element of academics is performing novel research—research that has been peer reviewed and is published in <em>academic journals</em>. However, academic journals have two <span id="page_94" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>issues: timeliness and applicability. Publishing a paper in an academic journal can take from a year to 18 months at the minimum—<em>after the work is done</em>. This delay is due to peer reviews and editing. In many cases, this means that academic research in journals is outdated by the time it is printed. What’s more, academics are seldom experts in the application of the technologies they research. They look at things as theoretical problems and ignore many of the applied aspects. An academic would examine things like defense in depth to secure a system addressing XYZ vulnerability, based on a theory, and not something that can be done in a practical sense. Academics deconstruct an issue to its base components to find an answer, but whether that answer is applicable in real life is a totally different issue.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec118">Requests for Comment (RFCs)</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Requests for comment (RFCs)</em> are the sets of standards used to define how the Internet and the protocols involved in the World Wide Web are established and managed. They are free and openly available, and unlike some constantly evolving items like wikis, they are fixed in time when written. Changes to these documents are formal and noted, and if an Internet standard requires updating, a new RFC is drafted and approved. These are useful as source documents because they list the details by which the protocols operate, including methods not widely used but available.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec119">Local Industry Groups</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Local industry groups</em> are a valuable resource from a couple perspectives. First, they are a good source of practical information concerning threats, threat actors, and what can be done to defend networks. Second, they are a solid networking source of information that enables one to get answers to questions that have been vetted by others in similar positions. Much of cybersecurity revolves around sharing of information between trusted parties, and joining and being active in local industry groups is a good way to build these trusted relationships. The time to build these relationships is before you need them, not when you need an answer or help.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec120">Social Media</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Social media</em> is ubiquitous these days, with a variety of different platforms targeting different market segments. At the end of the day, each of these platforms is designed so that users can share ideas with like-minded people. For example, Facebook or Instagram might not be the best place to have meaningful discussions concerning threat intelligence, but communicating with contacts on a business-oriented site like LinkedIn might be more appropriate. As with all sources, the key is in vetting the sources of information. Therefore, if your trusted colleagues have chosen one of the social media platforms and hang out there, then that is where you will probably find your answers. However, as with many sources of information, remember <em>caveat emptor</em> still applies.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec121"><span id="page_95" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Threat Feeds</h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Threat feeds</em> are very much like vulnerability feeds when you are evaluating them for utility as a research source. Understanding where the information comes from, how it has been vetted, and how it applies to your industry are all important elements. Likewise, the need exists for multiple, non-overlapping feeds, as there is no single source that covers all needs.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev1sec122">Adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)</h4>
<p class="noindent">The acronym <em>TTP</em> is used to describe how threat agents organize and orchestrate their efforts. Like any other organization, hackers evolve to use repeatable methods that are effective. These methods can be cataloged and understood as attack patterns, enabling defenses to have countering plays developed in advance. TTPs, or the patterns used by adversaries, are a key element of a threat intelligence program. Different sources of information associated with TTPs exist, and what is important is to find a solid source based on understandable sources that fit your industry.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev67">Chapter Review</h3>
<p class="noindent">This chapter covered five main topics; actors and threats, attributes of actors, vectors, threat intelligence sources, and research sources. Under actors and threats, the topics of APTs, insider threats, and nation-state actors were covered first, followed by hacktivists, script kiddies, criminal syndicates, and hackers (including white hat, black hat, and gray hat hackers). The section finished with a discussion of shadow IT and competitors. The section on the attributes of threat actors covered internal versus external threats, level of sophistication/capability, resources/funding, and intent/motivation.</p>
<p class="indent">The chapter then moved on to the topic of vectors, or pathways for attacks. This section included the topics of direct access, wireless, e-mail, and supply chain methods of entry. The section concluded with social media, removable media, and cloud vectors.</p>
<p class="indent">The chapter finished with sections covering threat intelligence sources and research sources. The section on threat intelligence sources opened with the topic of open source intelligence and closed/proprietary sources, followed by a discussion of vulnerability databases, public/private information-sharing centers, and the dark web as sources. The methods of indicators of compromise, Automated Indicator Sharing, and Structured Threat Information Expression/Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information were also presented. The threat intelligence sources section closed with predictive analysis, threat maps, and file/code repositories as sources. The final section of the chapter was an examination of research sources. These included vendor websites, vulnerability feeds, conferences, academic journals, and requests for comment. The last elements presented were local industry groups, social media, threat feeds, and adversaries’ tactics, techniques, and procedures.</p>

<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch5ans1" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#r_ch5ans1">1</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D.</strong> Removeable media is commonly linked to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch5ans2" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#r_ch5ans2">2</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C.</strong> Networking between peers is a useful attribute of local industry groups.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch5ans3" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#r_ch5ans3">3</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B.</strong> Hacktivists are hackers that are pursuing a mission associated with a cause.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch5ans4" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#r_ch5ans4">4</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D.</strong> Separation of duties is designed to provide defenses against malicious insiders. But nation-state actors and criminal organizations have the resources and abilities to hack accounts and gain insider access. There are no external accounts, so once a well-resourced hacker is in, they will have permissions associated with an insider.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch5ans5" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#r_ch5ans5">5</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A.</strong> File/code repositories is the correct answer because the code you are concerned about was developed in-house; hence, it will not show up in commercial databases or other sources.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch5ans6" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#r_ch5ans6">6</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B.</strong> An indicator of compromise (IoC) provides the details associated with how one can find active malware on a system.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch5ans7" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#r_ch5ans7">7</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D.</strong> This is a supply chain vector. Although the work was done in-house, the supply chain stretches from each part to functioning system, and you added the final software to create the functioning system, so your own team is part of the supply chain.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch5ans8" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#r_ch5ans8">8</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B.</strong> Adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) provide details on how an adversary operates.</p>
<p class="ques"><strong><a id="ch5ans9" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#r_ch5ans9">9</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A.</strong> Vectors is the correct answer because this is the only item you have any direct control over. The other items are real issues, just not ones you have any measure of direct control over.</p>
<p class="ques1"><strong><a id="ch5ans10" href="127.0.0.1/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9781260464016/ch5.xhtml#r_ch5ans10">10</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B.</strong> Open source intelligence is the best answer. Because you are looking for threat information, this eliminates vulnerability information as an answer. The dark web may or may not have information, and you would have to find it, and predictive analysis needs the information you seek in order to function.</p>
