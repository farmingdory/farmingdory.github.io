In this chapter, I describe the challenges that you face from the people who actually do the misdeeds, as well as their motivations and methods. This understanding better prepares you for your security tests.</span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.y5s5jdi9650b"><span class="c15 c4">What You&rsquo;re Up Against</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Thanks to sensationalism in the media, public perception of </span><span class="c2 c9">hacker</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;has transformed from a harmless tinkerer to a malicious criminal. Nevertheless, hackers often state that the public misunderstands them, which is mostly true. It&rsquo;s easy to prejudge &mdash; or misjudge &mdash; what you don&rsquo;t understand. Unfortunately, many hacker stereotypes are based on misunderstanding rather than fact, and that misunderstanding fuels a continued debate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Hackers can be classified by both their abilities and their underlying motivations. Some are skilled, and their motivations are benign; they&rsquo;re merely seeking more knowledge. Still, other hackers may have malicious intent and seek some form of personal, political, or economic gain. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of hacking usually overshadow the positive aspects and promote the negative stereotypes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Historically, hackers hacked for the pursuit of knowledge and the thrill of the challenge. </span><span class="c2 c9">Script kiddies</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(hacker wannabes with limited skills) aside, traditional hackers are adventurous and innovative thinkers who are always devising new ways to exploit computer vulnerabilities. (For more on script kiddies, see the section &ldquo;</span><span class="c18"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hacking-for-dummies/9781119872191/c02.xhtml%23c02-sec-0004&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141550264744&amp;usg=AOvVaw1b8kY7S5ry36Cp7o25RYb-">Who Breaks into Computer Systems</a></span><span class="c2 c4">&rdquo; later in this chapter.) Hackers see what others often overlook. They&rsquo;re very inquisitive and have good situational awareness. They wonder what would happen if a cable was unplugged, a switch was flipped, or lines of code were changed in a program. They do these things and then notice what happens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When they were growing up, hackers&rsquo; rivals were monsters and villains on video-game screens. Now hackers see their electronic foes as only that: </span><span class="c2 c9">electronic</span><span class="c2 c4">. Criminal hackers who perform malicious acts don&rsquo;t really think about the fact that human beings are behind the firewalls, web applications, and computer systems they&rsquo;re attacking. They ignore the fact that their actions often affect those human beings in negative ways, such as jeopardizing their job security and putting their personal safety at risk. Government-backed hacking? Well, that&rsquo;s a different story, as those hackers are making calculated decisions to do these things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">On the flip side, the odds are good that you have at least an employee, contractor, intern, or consultant who intends to compromise sensitive information on your network for malicious purposes. These people don&rsquo;t hack in the way that people normally suppose. Instead, they root around in files on server shares; delve into databases they know they shouldn&rsquo;t be in; and sometimes steal, modify, and delete sensitive information to which they have access. This behavior can be very hard to detect, especially given the widespread belief among management that users can and should be trusted to do the right things. This activity is perpetuated if these users passed their criminal background and credit checks before they were hired. Past behavior is often the best predictor of future behavior, but just because someone has had a clean record and authorization to access sensitive systems doesn&rsquo;t mean that they won&rsquo;t do anything bad. Criminal behavior has to start somewhere!</span></p><p class="c14"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;As negative as breaking into computer systems often can be, hackers and researchers play key roles in the advancement of technology. In a world without these people, the odds are good that the latest network and cloud controls, endpoint security, or vulnerability scanning and exploit tools would likely be different &mdash; if they existed at all. Such a world might not be bad, but technology does keep security professionals employed and the field moving forward. Unfortunately, the technical security solutions can&rsquo;t ward off all malicious attacks and unauthorized use because hackers and (sometimes) malicious users are usually a few steps ahead of the technology designed to protect against their wayward actions. Or, the people in charge of these technologies are so distracted that they miss the obvious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">However you view the stereotypical hacker or malicious user, one thing is certain: Somebody will always try to take down your computer systems and compromise information by poking and prodding where they shouldn&rsquo;t &mdash; through denial of service (DoS) attacks or by creating and launching malware, especially ransomware. You must take the appropriate steps to protect your systems against this kind of intrusion.</span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.a0d4j850nhv"><span class="c23 c4">THINKING LIKE THE BAD GUYS</span></h1><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c4">Malicious attackers often think and work like thieves, kidnappers, and other organized criminals you hear about in the news every day. The smart ones devise ways to fly under the radar and exploit even the smallest weaknesses that lead them to their targets. Following are examples of how hackers and malicious users think and work. This list isn&rsquo;t intended to highlight specific exploits that I cover in this book or tests that I recommend that you carry out, but it demonstrates the context and approach of a malicious mindset:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_f9pq3zqokjgz-0 start"><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Evading an intrusion prevention system</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;by changing the MAC or IP address every few minutes (or packets) to get farther into a network without being blocked.</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Exploiting a physical security weakness</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;by being aware of offices that have already been cleaned by the cleaning crew and are unoccupied (and, thus, easy to access with little chance of getting caught). For example, such a weakness might be made obvious by the fact that the office blinds are opened, and the curtains are pulled shut in the early morning.</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Bypassing web access controls</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;by elevating their privileges via a vulnerable web page, the application&rsquo;s login mechanism, or a vulnerable password reset process.</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Using unauthorized software that would otherwise be blocked at the firewall</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;by changing the default TCP port on which it runs.</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Setting up a wireless &ldquo;evil twin</span><span class="c6 c4">&rdquo; near a local Wi-Fi hotspot to entice unsuspecting Internet surfers onto a rogue network, where their information can be captured and easily manipulated.</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Using an overly trusting colleague&rsquo;s user ID and password</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;to gain access to sensitive information that they&rsquo;d otherwise be highly unlikely to obtain and that could then be used for ill-gotten gains.</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Unplugging the power cord or Ethernet connection to a networked security camera</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;that monitors access to the computer room or other sensitive areas and subsequently gaining unmonitored system access.</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Performing SQL injection or password cracking against a website</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;via a neighbor&rsquo;s unprotected wireless network to hide the malicious user&rsquo;s own identity.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c4">Malicious hackers operate in countless ways, and this list presents only a small number of the techniques hackers may use. IT and security professionals need to think and work this way to find security vulnerabilities that may not otherwise be uncovered.</span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.rrb0rjydygtf"><span class="c15 c4">Who Breaks into Computer Systems</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Computer hackers have been around for decades. Since the Internet became widely used in the 1990s, the mainstream public has started to hear more about hacking. Certain hackers, such as John Draper (also known as Captain Crunch) and Kevin Mitnick, are well known. Many more unknown hackers are looking to make names for themselves, and they&rsquo;re the ones you have to look out for.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In a world of black and white, describing the typical hacker is easy. The historical stereotype of a hacker is an antisocial, pimply teenage boy. But the world has many shades of gray, and many types of people do the hacking. Hackers are unique people, so a profile is hard to outline. The best broad description of hackers is that all hackers </span><span class="c2 c9">aren&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;equal. Each hacker has unique motives, methods, and skills.</span></p><h3 class="c21" id="h.b3pmck6dbjtw"><span class="c4 c25">Hacker skill levels</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Hacker skill levels fall into three general categories:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_2o13g6gqzpug-0 start"><li class="c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Script kiddies:</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;These hackers are computer novices who take advantage of the exploit tools, vulnerability scanners, and documentation available free on the Internet but who don&rsquo;t have any real knowledge of what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes. They know just enough to cause you headaches but typically are very sloppy in their actions, leaving all sorts of digital fingerprints behind. Even though these guys are often the stereotypical hackers that you hear about in the news media, they need only minimal skills to carry out their attacks.</span></li><li class="c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Criminal hackers:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Sometimes referred to as </span><span class="c6 c9">crackers,</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;these hackers are skilled criminal experts who write some of the hacking tools, including the scripts and other programs that the script kiddies and security professionals use. These folks also write malware to carry out their exploits from the other side of the world. They can break into networks and computers and cover their tracks. They can even make it look as though someone else hacked their victims&rsquo; systems. Sometimes, people with ill intent may not be doing what&rsquo;s considered to be hacking; nevertheless, they&rsquo;re abusing their privileges or somehow gaining unauthorized access.<br>Advanced hackers are often members of collectives that prefer to remain nameless. These hackers are very secretive, sharing information with their subordinates (lower-ranked hackers in the collectives) only when they deem those subordinates to be worthy. Typically, for lower-ranked hackers to be considered worthy, they must possess unique information or take the ganglike approach by proving themselves through a high-profile hack. These hackers are some of your worst enemies in IT. (Okay, maybe they&rsquo;re not as bad as untrained and careless users, but they&rsquo;re close. They do go hand in hand, after all!) By understanding criminal hacker behavior, you&rsquo;re simply being proactive, finding problems before they become problems.</span></li><li class="c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Security researchers:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;These people are highly technical, publicly (or somewhat publicly) known security experts who not only monitor and track computer, network, and application vulnerabilities, but they also write tools and other code to exploit them. If these guys didn&rsquo;t exist, security professionals wouldn&rsquo;t have much in the way of open-source and even certain commercial security testing tools.<br></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;I follow many of these security researchers on a weekly basis via their personal or company blogs, Twitter feeds, and articles, and you should too.

There are also </span><span class="c2 c9">blue-hat</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;hackers, outsiders who are hired to find security flaws in client systems. Blue-hat hackers are more recently referred to as purple-hat hackers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">A study from the Black Hat security conference found that everyday IT professionals even engage in malicious and criminal activity against others. And people wonder why IT doesn&rsquo;t get the respect it deserves!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Regardless of age and complexion, hackers possess curiosity, bravado, and often very sharp minds.</span></p><h3 class="c21" id="h.p4izm8kfd8m2"><span class="c25 c4">Hacker motivations</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Perhaps more important than a hacker&rsquo;s skill level is their motivation. The following groups of hackers have different motivations:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_jny5f1e6af8g-0 start"><li class="c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Hacktivists:</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;These hackers try to disseminate political or social messages through their work. A hacktivist wants to raise public awareness of an issue but wants to remain anonymous. In many situations, these hackers try to take you down if you express a view that&rsquo;s contrary to theirs. Examples of hacktivism are the websites that were defaced by the &ldquo;Free Kevin&rdquo; messages that promoted freeing Kevin Mitnick, who was in prison for his famous hacking escapades. Others cases of hacktivism include messages about legalized drugs, antiwar protests, wealth envy, big corporations, and just about any other social and political issue you can think of.</span></li><li class="c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Terrorists:</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;Terrorists (both organized and unorganized and often backed by government agencies) attack corporate or government computers and public utility infrastructures such as power grids and air-traffic control towers. They crash critical systems, steal classified data, and/or expose the personal information of government employees. Countries take the threats that these terrorists pose so seriously that many mandate information security controls in crucial industries, such as the power industry, to protect essential systems from these attacks.</span></li><li class="c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Hackers for hire:</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;These hackers are often (but not always) part of organized crime on the Internet. Many of these hackers hire out themselves or their ransomware and DoS-creating botnets for money &mdash; lots of it!</span></li></ul><p class="c14"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;Criminal hackers are in the minority, so don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re up against millions of these villains. Like the email spam kings of the world, many members of collectives prefer to remain nameless; the nefarious acts are carried out by a small number of criminals. Many other hackers just love to tinker and only seek knowledge of how computer systems work. One of your greatest threats works inside your building and has an access badge to the building, a network account, and hair on top, so don&rsquo;t discount the insider threat.</span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.4rkt62iqxyxb"><span class="c15 c4">Why They Do It</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Hackers hack because they can. Period. Okay, the reason goes a little deeper. Hacking is a hobby for some hackers; they hack just to see what they can and can&rsquo;t break into, usually testing only their own systems. These folks aren&rsquo;t the ones I write about in this book. Instead, I focus on those hackers who are obsessive about gaining notoriety or defeating computer systems and those who have criminal intentions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Many hackers get a kick out of outsmarting corporate and government IT and security administrators. They thrive on making headlines and being notorious. Defeating an entity or possessing knowledge that few other people have makes them feel better about themselves, building their self-esteem. Many of these hackers feed off the instant gratification of exploiting a computer system. They become obsessed with this feeling. Some hackers can&rsquo;t resist the adrenaline rush they get from breaking into someone else&rsquo;s systems. Often, the more difficult the job is, the greater the thrill is for hackers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s a bit ironic, given their collective tendencies, but hackers often promote individualism &mdash; or at least the decentralization of information &mdash; because many of them believe that all information should be free. They think their attacks are different from attacks in the real world. Hackers may ignore or misunderstand their victims and the consequences of hacking. They don&rsquo;t think about the long-term effects of the choices they&rsquo;re making today. Many hackers say that they don&rsquo;t intend to harm or profit through their bad deeds, and this belief helps them justify their work. Others don&rsquo;t look for tangible payoffs; just proving a point is often a sufficient reward for them. The word </span><span class="c2 c9">sociopath</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;comes to mind when describing many such people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">The knowledge that malicious attackers gain and the self-esteem boost that comes from successful hacking may become an addiction and a way of life. Some attackers want to make your life miserable, and others simply want to be seen or heard. Some common motives are revenge, bragging rights, curiosity, boredom, challenge, vandalism, theft for financial gain, sabotage, blackmail, extortion, corporate espionage, and just generally speaking out against &ldquo;the man.&rdquo; Hackers regularly cite these motives to explain their behavior, but they tend to cite these motivations more commonly during difficult economic conditions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Malicious users inside your network may be looking to gain information to help them with personal financial problems, to give them a leg up on a competitor, to seek revenge on their employers, to satisfy their curiosity, or to relieve boredom.</span></p><p class="c14"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;Many business owners and managers &mdash; even some network and security administrators &mdash; believe that they don&rsquo;t have anything that a hacker wants or that hackers can&rsquo;t do much damage if they break in. These beliefs are sorely mistaken. This dismissive kind of thinking helps support the bad guys and promote their objectives. Hackers can compromise a seemingly unimportant system to access the network and use it as a launching pad for attacks on other systems, and many people would be none the wiser because they don&rsquo;t have the proper controls to prevent and detect malicious use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hackers often hack simply </span><span class="c2 c9">because they can</span><span class="c2 c4">. Some hackers go for high-profile systems, but hacking into anyone&rsquo;s system helps them fit into hacker circles. Hackers exploit many people&rsquo;s false sense of security and go for almost any system they think they can compromise. Electronic information can be in more than one place at the same time, so if hackers merely copy information from the systems they break into, it&rsquo;s tough to prove that hackers possess that information, and it&rsquo;s impossible to get the information back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Similarly, hackers know that a simple defaced web page &mdash; however easily attacked &mdash; isn&rsquo;t good for someone else&rsquo;s business. It often takes a large-scale data breach, ransomware infection, or a phishing attack that spawns the unauthorized wire transfer of a large sum of money to get the attention of business executives. But hacked sites can often persuade management and other nonbelievers to address information threats and vulnerabilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Many recent studies have revealed that most security flaws are basic in nature, which is exactly what I see in my security assessments. I call these basic flaws the </span><span class="c2 c9">low-hanging fruit</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;of the network, just waiting to be exploited. Computer breaches continue to become more common and are often easier to execute yet harder to prevent for several reasons:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_v48irk46tiuj-0 start"><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c4">Widespread use of networks and Internet connectivity</span></li><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c4">Anonymity provided by computer systems on the Internet and often on internal networks (because proper and effective logging, monitoring, and alerting rarely take place)</span></li><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c4">Greater number and availability of hacking tools</span></li><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c4">Large number of open wireless networks that help criminals cover their tracks</span></li><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c4">Greater complexity of networks and codebases in the applications and databases being developed today</span></li><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c4">Na&iuml;ve yet computer-savvy children who are eager to give up privacy (which is easy because they&rsquo;ve never experienced it) for free stuff</span></li><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c4">Ransoms paid by cyberinsurance policies can be huge</span></li><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c4">Likelihood that attackers won&rsquo;t be investigated or prosecuted if caught</span></li></ul><p class="c14"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Remember" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;A malicious hacker needs to find only one security hole, whereas IT and security professionals and business owners must find and resolve all of them!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Although many attacks go unnoticed or unreported, criminals who are discovered may not be pursued or prosecuted. When they&rsquo;re caught, hackers often rationalize their services as being altruistic and a benefit to society: They&rsquo;re merely pointing out vulnerabilities before someone else does. Regardless, if hackers are caught and prosecuted, the &ldquo;fame and glory&rdquo; reward system that hackers thrive on is threatened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">The same goes for malicious users. Typically, their criminal activity goes unnoticed, but if they&rsquo;re caught, the security breach may be kept hush-hush in the name of protecting shareholder value or not ruffling any customer or business-partner feathers. Information security and privacy laws and regulations, however, are changing this situation, because in most cases, breach notification is required. Sometimes, the malicious user is fired or asked to resign. Although public cases of internal breaches are becoming more common (usually through breach disclosure laws), these cases don&rsquo;t give a full picture of what&rsquo;s taking place in the average organization.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Regardless of whether they want to, most executives now have to deal with all the state, federal, and international laws and regulations that require notifications of breaches or suspected breaches of sensitive information. These requirements apply to external hacks, internal breaches, and even seemingly benign things such as lost mobile devices and backup tapes. The appendix lists the information security and privacy laws and regulations that may affect your business.</span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.sy09r48xtwry"><span class="c4 c23">HACKING IN THE NAME OF LIBERTY?</span></h1><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c4">Many hackers exhibit behaviors that contradict their stated purposes. They fight for civil liberties and want to be left alone, but at the same time, they love prying into the business of others and controlling them in any way possible. Many hackers call themselves civil libertarians and claim to support the principles of personal privacy and freedom, but they contradict their words by intruding on the privacy and property of other people. They steal the property and violate the rights of others but go to great lengths to get their own rights back from anyone who threatens them. The situation is &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo; gone awry.</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c4">The case involving copyrighted materials and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is a classic example. Hackers have gone to great lengths to prove a point, defacing the websites of organizations that support copyrights and then sharing music and software themselves. Go figure.</span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.g0kyy0npe15n"><span class="c15 c4">Planning and Performing Attacks</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Attack styles vary widely:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_8i12h4i6oadw-0 start"><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Some hackers prepare far in advance of an attack.

Such hackers may try, for example, to telnet directly into an organization&rsquo;s router without hiding their identities. Other hackers may try to launch a DoS attack against a web server without first determining the version running on the server or the installed patches. These hackers usually are caught or at least blocked.</span></li><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c4">Malicious users are all over the map. Some are quite savvy, based on their knowledge of the network and of how IT and security operates inside the organization. Others go poking and prodding in systems that they shouldn&rsquo;t be in &mdash; or shouldn&rsquo;t have had access to in the first place &mdash; and often do stupid things that lead security or network administrators back to them.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Although the hacker underground is a community, many hackers &mdash; especially advanced hackers &mdash; don&rsquo;t share information with the crowd. Most hackers do much of their work independently to remain anonymous.</span></p><p class="c14"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px;"><img alt="Tip" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 60.00px; height: 78.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;Hackers who network with one another often use private message boards, anonymous email addresses, or hacker underground websites (a.k.a. the deep web or dark web). You can attempt to log in to such sites to see what hackers are doing, but I don&rsquo;t recommend it unless you really know what you&rsquo;re doing. The last thing you need is to get a malware infection or lose sensitive login credentials when trying to sniff around these places.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Whatever approach they take, most malicious attackers prey on ignorance. They know the following aspects of real-world security:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_4xzslyw6gpdf-0 start"><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">The majority of computer systems aren&rsquo;t managed properly.</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;The computer systems aren&rsquo;t properly patched, hardened, or monitored. Attackers can often fly below the radar of the average firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS), especially malicious users whose actions aren&rsquo;t monitored yet who have full access to the very environment they can exploit.</span></li><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Most network and security administrators can&rsquo;t keep up with the deluge of new vulnerabilities and attack methods.</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;These people have too many tasks to stay on top of and too many other fires to put out. Network and security administrators may fail to notice or respond to security events because of poor time and goal management. I provide resources on time and goal management for IT and security professionals in the appendix.</span></li><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Information systems grow more complex every year.</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;This fact is yet another reason why overburdened administrators find it difficult to know what&rsquo;s happening across the wire and on the hard drives of all their systems. Virtualization, cloud services, and mobile devices such as laptops, tablets, and phones are the foundation of this complexity. The Internet of Things complicates everything. More recently, because so many people are working remotely and often using vulnerable personal computers to access business systems makes, complexity has grown even more.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Time is an attacker&rsquo;s friend, and it&rsquo;s almost always on their side. By attacking through computers rather than in person, hackers have more control of the timing of their attacks. Attacks are not only carried out anonymously, but they can be carried out slowly over time, making them hard to detect. Quantum computing will make these attacks that much faster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Attacks are frequently carried out after typical business hours, often in the middle of the night and (in the case of malicious users) from home. Defenses may be weaker after hours, with less physical security and less intrusion monitoring, when the typical network administrator or security guard is sleeping.</span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.9v8zdl4ycciy"><span class="c23 c4">HACKING MAGAZINES</span></h1><p class="c20"><span class="c16 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c4">If you want detailed information on how some hackers work or want to keep up with the latest hacker methods, several magazines are worth checking out:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_vcxc8d48qbla-0 start"><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c9">2600 &mdash; The Hacker Quarterly</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.2600.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141550277454&amp;usg=AOvVaw2knsLgyip_NxxhTUOMCM_v">www.2600.com</a></span><span class="c6 c4">)</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c9">(IN)SECURE</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;magazine (</span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.helpnetsecurity.com/insecuremag-archive&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141550277893&amp;usg=AOvVaw0THhHYGJif1z6ez_CQgUxz">www.helpnetsecurity.com/insecuremag-archive</a></span><span class="c6 c4">)</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c9">Hackin9</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hakin9.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141550278244&amp;usg=AOvVaw2fsRSkd0ObQtHOnQQ9Exb6">https://hakin9.org</a></span><span class="c6 c4">)</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c9">PHRACK</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.phrack.org/archives/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1681141550278586&amp;usg=AOvVaw0rNpLvR1yTfd1OI2bGe-oD">www.phrack.org/archives</a></span><span class="c6 c4">)</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c4">Malicious attackers usually learn from their mistakes.
