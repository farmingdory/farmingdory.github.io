A house is a great example, as it allows you to think about the controls you use to limit your risk of the house being compromised due to break-in, fire, flooding, and so forth. We spend most of our time in security attempting to limit risk and counter threats, not eliminate them. A </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">risk</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> is the potential for loss of an asset or damage to an asset, whereas a </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">threat</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> is the activity that takes advantage of a weakness in an asset. Risk and threats can never be eliminated. Similar to a house, we can’t eliminate the risk of fire, flood, or a break-in; we can only detect and respond while attempting to limit the risk and impact. To be clear, risk can never be eliminated, only reduced.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998537"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-callout-head">NOTE</span><span class="css-zv7ju9"> In the case of a house fire, the fire is the threat, while the house burning down is the risk.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998550"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Whereas fire, flood, and break-in are risks that impact a house, our software has a different set of threats and risks.

At each point, the protection of that data is paramount, especially if it is sensitive data like payment information. Today, we have methods to protect this information, primarily through encryption at rest when it resides in a database or other system, encryption in transit as it moves over the network, and encryption in use as it is processed in memory. These methods allow us to provide some protection of data as it traverses our systems, and in some cases even the services that your software sends data to.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-998721"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">2.2.1 Data protection policy</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="marker-1010044"></a><a name="pgfId-998733"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The </span><a name="marker-1010057"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">first</span><a name="marker-1010070"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> step</span><a name="marker-1010083"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> an organization needs to take to maintain data protection is to create and maintain a policy that clearly outlines what data must be encrypted.

Put simply, data inventory is the ability to know where data is located in an organization. During a security incident, an organization needs to be able to know what data may have been compromised and whether there is a risk related to the data that was compromised. Is it critical client information that was on that database that was just breached? If this can’t be answered, then there is a gap in understanding where the data is and what the nature of that data is. Review figure 2.1 again: Do you know what is happening to that information that is passed between your application and the payment company? Do you know whether they are sharing data with others, knowingly or not? Do you or the consumers of your application have a policy that disallows developers to copy data from a production environment to a lower environment? If so, is it enforced?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-998856"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">These examples are not intended to frighten, but to bring awareness to the fact that data is everywhere and that the first step in securing this data is to get an inventory.

These questionnaires are simple in nature and should be completed by the data custodian who is responsible for the technical implementation and maintenance of data within the system. Each organization should create its own survey that attempts to determine the type of data that is moving through the system and should focus on the sensitivity of the data that aligns to the classification that the organization uses. They are also responsible for ensuring that this survey is kept up-to-date as the architecture changes and can incorporate that update during the development process.

You need an encryption and decryption key (sometimes the same key), a secure method to create an encryption key, a secure location to store the key, and a way to distribute and access the key in a programmatic way. Depending on the architecture and deployment of your application, the ability to securely generate and store a key may be limited. Most legacy systems are limited in their ability to store an encryption and decryption key. The key or keys are often stored in a configuration file, or worse, hardcoded in software. More modern architectures will take advantage of a hardware security module (HSM</span><a name="marker-1010278"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) that allows the application to make secure API calls to a physical device that stores encryption keys and can be configured to auto expire, rotate, and generate keys as shown in figure 2.2. Today, many organizations are under regulatory or contractual obligations to provide better encryption methods such as the use of an HSM to encrypt sensitive data and even allow for their customers to manage their own keys. However, although an HSM will provide the highest level of secure access to data encryption and decryption keys, they are expensive and can be a single point of failure if the hardware becomes unavailable. There are cloud HSMs that are available that can reduce the need for the organization to maintain expensive hardware, but be aware that prices can vary and can increase as you add more encryption keys under management.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin:24pt 30pt 18pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><img src="images/Aspose.Words.c5ee19dd-1ada-48f2-bc44-b61efe65ced6.002.png" width="623" height="278" alt="" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline" /></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:24pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1015844"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#000055">Figure 2.2 HSM in a simple workflow to encrypt a database</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; vertical-align:top; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1015810"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="vertical-align:top; color:#000055">Exercise 2.1</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1015811"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Go through the assignment on symmetric encryption and get familiar with the way a single key can be used to encrypt and decrypt data (</span><a href="http://mng.bz/yvlB" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentalink" style="text-decoration:underline">http://mng.bz/yvlB</span></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">).You should also go through the assignment on public key encryption to get familiar with key generation, as well as encryption and decryption using a key pair (</span><a href="http://mng.bz/M5NW" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentalink" style="text-decoration:underline">http://mng.bz/M5NW</span></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">).</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999378"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Depending on your organization and the industry you are in, you will most likely have to encrypt at least restricted and confidential data.

One of the considerations for these organization is that information could be located outside of a database and could instead be in unstructured data like text documents, PDFs, or image files.

Additionally, if a user has access to the encryption or decryption keys, they are also able to view this data or encrypt data as if they were a legitimate service. Traceability of these sensitive activities can be met by using tools that provide access to the privileged account while also providing auditing capability. Usually, the auditing within the tool is completed through screen activity captures, keystroke logging, and auto filling passwords so that it’s not accessible to the end user.

Today, almost every website you go to is now TLS enabled, and you will be redirected to HTTPS if you attempt to go to a site with just HTTP. Several factors played into the adoption of TLS. The browsers played a large role in this as they began to mark sites “insecure” if they did not use TLS or even if they used a known weak version of TLS. Additionally, security over the years has become not just an obscure corner of an organization, but increasingly a concern for everyday users. Users may not know, or want to know, how TLS works. But they do want to know that when they input their credit card number into a website, that the number will be protected. Most users today are becoming accustomed to making sure that they see some version of a padlock or other indicator that the site they are on is using a secure connection.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999558"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Although the versions and ciphers associated with TLS often change as new vulnerabilities are discovered, TLS is easily enabled.

As you can tell, enabling TLS can be mostly simple, but there are operational costs. Similar to the key management problems discussed earlier, certificates have a life cycle and need to be renewed or replaced periodically. Additionally, some of the fundamental underpinnings of the technology can occasionally change and lead to the need to make drastic changes. In fact, in 2016, browsers began to display security warnings for certificates that were generated using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm with users being able to click through the message and continue to the site. By the end of 2018, browsers like Chrome were alerting users that they would disallow access to sites using the less secure SHA-1 at the beginning of 2019.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999628"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">I had the pleasure of leading a project at a large organization with the directive to update all the certificates we had to SHA-2. This was no small task. Identifying all the use cases where these certifications were used—like single sign-on SAML certificates, TLS, FTP, digital signing, and others—was difficult. Additionally, locating where these certificates were stored was a further complication. They are found on filesystems, key stores, web servers, and databases. Changing them without creating an outage required tight coordination between the development, security, client, and operational teams. Inevitably, there were rollbacks when something did not go as planned.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999637"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Never fear, though, as with encryption keys, there are tools that can be used to manage, rotate, issue, and alert on the expiration of certificates. There are also protocols such as the Automated Certificate Management Environment (</span><a name="marker-1010447"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">ACME</span><a name="marker-1010434"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) that can be used to create CSRs and manage keys and certificates. It is part of the business model for Let’s Encrypt certificate authority, which allows them to issue certificates quickly and efficiently and provide short expirations of around 90 days. This short expiration date provides the ability for web servers to frequently change certificates and reduce the amount of time that a certificate is in circulation. Not that long ago, certificates would have an expiration of 5, 10, or even 30 years. For the sake of security, the industry has begun moving away from this practice and is looking for much shorter time frames to provide better security.

The data will be transferred between the two entities and is protected regardless of whether it is transmitted over a nonsecure channel like HTTP. However, you still have a dependency on the key management. Transmitting the key opens each end to a possible compromise.

Protection of data in use means when it is being accessed in nonpersistent states like memory or in the CPU. Additionally, this means that data is protected throughout its entire life cycle when combined with encryption of data at rest and transit. In general, well-designed systems will ensure that access to data in use is only accessible to the parts of the system that should have access. This will limit access to memory by malware and other processes. This should protect against not just writing and reading, but also executing of code when not allowed.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999698"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Many of the methods for protection are through the host level or operating system level controls like using segmentation, protection rings, or paged virtual memory.

While information contained in an email can be concerning, it’s also important to know that by most standards, an email address alone is considered PII. In February of 2020, the father of UK prime minister Boris Johnson caused a bit of an international stir when he accidentally copied the BBC on an email to British officials regarding the lack of contact between Boris Johnson and the Chinese state over the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Later that year, Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade exposed 1,000 citizens’ personal data when an employee failed to use BCC to send information regarding emergency loans and reentry quotas for citizens stuck in other countries due to COVID-19 restrictions.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999746"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">However, where email is an excellent avenue for leaking information, it tends to be smaller than the big breaches.

This API allowed unauthenticated access, meaning that you did not have to have an account or special access. Peloton initially only limited access to the API to users with a Peloton account; however, this only limited the audience, and anyone could sign up for a Peloton account and access the API to gather the personal information of other users. Eventually Peloton fully corrected the authentication issue, but they were not able to confirm or deny whether their over 3 million users had their data accessed or stolen due to </span><a name="marker-1010746"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">the </span><a name="marker-1010720"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">issue.</span><a name="marker-1010733"></a></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-999755"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">2.2.8 Do I even need this?</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999767"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">You </span><a name="marker-1010759"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">may </span><a name="marker-1010772"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">be familiar with Marie Kondo, who is famous for her show on Netflix called </span><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics">Tidying Up with Marie Kondo</span><a name="marker-1010785"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">.

Often, she asks the question: “Does this spark joy?” What does this have to do with security and specifically data security? One of the first things I usually ask when I get involved with reviewing security decisions and architecture that involves sensitive data is whether the data needs to actually be collected and retained. If you don’t need to keep it or act upon it, then you don’t need to worry about securing it. To be clear, securing it means more cost and effort. Something that not many product owners will be willing to spend if they don’t need the data. Therefore, limiting the collection of this sensitive data is the best way to secure it. However, organizations and application development teams will err on the side of collecting more data because you may need it at some time, and storage is cheap.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999778"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Here are some questions that you need to ask regarding data:</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-top:18pt; margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-999787"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Do you need to store that data?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-999799"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Do you have regulations or contracts that require to maintain the data?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-999811"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Can you properly classify this data?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-999823"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Can you provide the appropriate level of protection for the collected data?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-999835"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Do you know when you no longer need it and can destroy it?</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999847"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">If you can answer these questions in the affirmative, then you are on the right path.

One of the most iconic episodes is when Lucy and her friend Ethel worked in a candy factory to make some money. They were assigned to the candy wrapping station where candy would pass by on a conveyor belt and the two would have to wrap each one. Naturally, at first the conveyor belt moved along at a reasonable pace, and the two friends were able to successfully wrap each piece of candy that went by. Soon the belt began to move much quicker, and with more candy. The two friends were quickly overwhelmed and began to stuff candy in their pockets and mouths while missing most of the candy that went by.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999964"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">This is a simple example of a DoS attack, where the system can be tricked into accepting what appears to be normal traffic, at high volume, by a malicious actor. In other words, the candy coming down the belt is still legitimate and should be there, but the system setup to properly handle that candy is unable to handle the large amount being sent. Now, in this example, it’s easy to laugh it off because it’s a simple yet visually accurate example of a denial of service. In the real world, these attacks can be dire. Increasingly over the years these attacks have also grown in size. Early DDoS attacks were small in size and would use something like a SYN flood that would send a large number of TCP synchronize (SYN) packets without closing them out. It was simple, yet effective. More importantly, almost anyone could do this. Attacks today are much more sophisticated and larger, reaching over 2 terabits per second in some cases. To put that into perspective, that is 1,000,000,000,000 bits per second, or roughly 1,000 hours’ worth of movies.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-999973"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">DDoS attacks are not limited to just network-level attacks.

Obviously, an encrypted database will render your application useless in most cases.

One of the most iconic bridges in the world is San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. Known as one of the Wonders of the Modern World, the Golden Gate Bridge connects the San Francisco Bay with the Pacific Ocean. Construction began in 1933 and was completed four years later. The Golden Gate Bridge is a great real-world example of building for resiliency. Not only was the construction of the bridge an extreme modern marvel, but there are also unique considerations for places like San Francisco, namely earthquakes. The Golden Gate Bridge is within close proximity to the San Andreas Fault, which produces frequent seismic activity, some of which can be devastating to the area. It has survived several large earthquakes over its 80-plus years of existence, but not without the need of constant review and rework. Several projects are ongoing to make it more secure against not only earthquakes but also high winds. What does this have to do with software? Risk management in architecture is not much different whether you are building a bridge across a peninsula or developing an application to deliver value to your customers. Architecture, design, and development all need to consider the what-if scenarios and plan for possible attacks, failures, or errors, some of which could be intentional.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000196"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Your application should be designed and architected in a way that takes into consideration the type of risks and threat actors that may be looking for weaknesses in your specific application. Similar to the Golden Gate Bridge needing to be built to withstand winds as well as potentially large earthquakes, a health care application needs to be built to withstand a cyberattack that is attempting to ransomware your client data in order to turn the downtime into a profit. Your gambling application must consider criminals looking to DDoS your application to extort your organization. Your critical infrastructure application must be prepared to handle an advanced persistent threat looking to shut down your system to cripple key parts of a nation. We will talk more about these in the next sections.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000206"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">One of the simple methods of building in resiliency is to add more processing power. Scaling vertically means you are creating bigger systems. Scaling horizontally means you are adding more systems. This is easier said than done. However, the migration to cloud-first architecture makes this easier, albeit expensive. Additionally, building segmentation into your architecture reduces the “blast radius” of a potential attack. If you always assume that one of your systems is compromised, you will look at your architecture much differently. Similarly, there have been books written on the principles of chaos engineering, which in its simplest form means injecting a bit of chaos into a system to identify issues in order to prevent full-on outages. Think of trying to find a pinhole in a tire. You might rub some soapy water around it and put it under pressure to look for where the bubbles show. This is similar to the concept of chaos engineering where the team develops a hypothesis, tests it, and then works to fix what was discovered in the test:</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-top:18pt; margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-1000215"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics" style="color:#3d3b49">Develop a hypothesis</span><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">—The application will respond gracefully if an external service is not available.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-1000228"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics" style="color:#3d3b49">Test the hypothesis</span><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">—Route HTTP from the application to a nonexistent service and observe the failure condition.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentullip" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:48pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff; -aw-import:list-item; -aw-list-level-number:0; -aw-list-number-format:''; -aw-list-number-styles:'bullet'"><span style="-aw-import:ignore"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49"><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="font-family:Symbol"></span></span></span><a name="pgfId-1000241"></a><span class="sbo-rt-contentfm-italics" style="color:#3d3b49">Fix</span><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">—If required, identify the issues, resolve them, and improve processes.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000254"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">One last comment regarding building resiliency in.

Learning from mistakes and failures is the best method of building more resilient systems. A typical component of learning from failures is in a postmortem or a root cause analysis.

This requires the application to trust that data has not been tampered with whether in transit or at rest.

The request leaves the browser in a GET or POST and traverses the network as a packet, which lands on several network devices. It is then received by a load balancer or proxy or a WAF, and it hits a web server, an application server, and a database. By the way, it’s most likely been logged in a few of those locations and sent to a separate, centralized logging system. Not all paths through a system are the same, but in general this holds true for most HTTP requests made today and can be as simple as the diagram in figure 2.5. At each one of those steps there is the potential for a user or an account to gain access to view, copy, or corrupt the data through intentional or unintentional manipulation.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin:24pt 30pt 18pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><img src="images/Aspose.Words.c5ee19dd-1ada-48f2-bc44-b61efe65ced6.005.png" width="407" height="255" alt="" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline" /></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:24pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1015981"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#000055">Figure 2.5 Simple HTTP request with a reverse proxy</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000343"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Access control and monitoring is primarily used to determine what accounts have had contact with data as it has gone through a system.

Or it can be as complex as a privilege access management (PAM) system that requires a user to check out account access to sensitive systems where actions and keystrokes are logged. There are systems and security models in between that will provide varying level of access control. The key takeaway is to ensure that you can trace access, down to the individual file, to a physical person or user account. The moment that you have something like a shared account, you lose the ability to trace activity to a single account or individual. These accounts are ones that have a shared username and password that are used by a group of individuals.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000353"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Nonrepudiation is a form of access control that grants the application the ability to track an action or activity back to an identity.

You would usually attempt to roll back to a known good state or at least be able to view an older file and compare it to the current so that you can determine what broke. Version control software performs the function of providing control and visibility into files over time.

In relation to software security, the VCS that is used allows for the application security team to perform code reviews on sensitive code. For instance, a change may have been made in the code that impacts the authentication of the application. In this case, the engineering team may request that the application security team review the code for any increased risk due to the change. Additionally, if the VCS provides the ability to run tasks, the application security team can use this point to perform automated security testing to uncover vulnerabilities, like using a </span><a name="marker-1012046"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">static </span><a name="marker-1012033"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">analysis </span><a name="marker-1012007"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">tool.</span><a name="marker-1012020"></a></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-1000426"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">2.4.3 Data validation</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000438"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">An </span><a name="marker-1012059"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">additional </span><a name="marker-1012072"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">consideration </span><a name="marker-1012085"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">when </span><a name="marker-1012098"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">maintaining data integrity is to maintain the data as it is initially brought into your system through a user or service.

It can be as complex as writing regular expressions that look for specific characters and other requirements. Many development frameworks may even have data validation built into the framework. However, ultimately, the validation strategy should ensure that the input data is both within the constraints of the value it is expecting and also makes sense from a logic perspective.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000473"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Depending on your development framework, validation techniques are natively available and can be leveraged to check common constraints on size, type, schema, and others. One consideration when developing validation, either using the native elements of your framework or developing your own, is that taking the allowlist approach is more effective than the deny list. What this means is that the application should specify what it allows, and not what it blocks. It is apparent that a deny list will need constant maintenance and will not always catch novel approaches to circumventing the validation. An allowlist will only permit the values that the application is expecting to work with and is a more secure method.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000482"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">One last point on the input validation is that it is not sufficient to examine the input only on the client side.

Data backup requires more than just replication, including testing and integrity checks. What replication does entail is making multiple copies of data in different locations to be able to absorb potential data loss or corruption in one copy. This provides not only better availability and lower latency but also the ability to restore to a known good state should something go wrong. Although there are file and system backups that should be in place, the application architecture should include the ability to distribute data through a clustered database. While in this scheme, data is split so that different fragments go to different nodes and are retrieved in a manner that will then consolidate the different fragments back to the original data. Replication of the data will provide the additional layer of making sure that a failure at one node does not limit the ability for the cluster to retrieve the data. There is one important caveat. Data replication can lead to the replication of bad data as well in the case where an attacker is able to corrupt the source that then gets replicated.

These are values that provide a fingerprint for a given input. This is essentially a hash of an input, which means that it can only be done in one direction as shown in figure 2.6. In other words, the plain text is turned into a hash value, but the hash cannot be returned to the plain text. Checksums and hashes are not necessarily different from each other except for their purposes. Where hashes are an output of a mathematical function that is intended to create a unique value, a checksum is used to make a comparison and then decide whether a value has changed or not.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin:24pt 30pt 18pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><img src="images/Aspose.Words.c5ee19dd-1ada-48f2-bc44-b61efe65ced6.006.png" width="624" height="316" alt="" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline" /></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentfigurep" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:24pt; padding-top:4pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1016019"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#000055">Figure 2.6 Hash validation utility</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000552"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Another example of a generated code that provides data integrity assurance is the message authentication code (MAC</span><a name="marker-1012346"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">).

This type of motivation may make their attacks less impactful, but they </span><a name="marker-1012882"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">are </span><a name="marker-1012869"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">still </span><a name="marker-1012856"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">widespread.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; vertical-align:top; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1016092"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="vertical-align:top; color:#000055">Botnets</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1016093"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">Botnets are a common attack tool used by script kiddies. This is a method used to perform DDoS attacks at scale. These networks of bots are compromised devices that have malicious code injected into them so that they may be used in a future attack. Most of the time they are used to target organizations for volumetric types of attacks like DDoS. They can be Internet of Things (IoT</span><a name="marker-1016094"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">) devices, laptops, desktops, printers, or any other device that has an internet connection and can be used to make web calls. Some of these botnets are even for sale or can be rented for a period of time. For this type of attack, most organizations are not equipped to mitigate it themselves and need to look for outside help in the form of firewalls both at the application and at the network layer. Other controls require your organization to know the type of traffic that it is expecting to see and where it comes from so that the controls can be put in place to limit activity to just those known locations. This might require geofencing that limits traffic to known good countries or locations.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-1000864"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">2.6.2 Insider</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="marker-1012895"></a><a name="pgfId-1000876"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The </span><a name="marker-1012911"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">insider</span><a name="marker-1012924"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9"> threat </span><a name="marker-1012937"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">is an often-overlooked category.

What if they are no longer “feeling” their job? These things do happen. Although it is fair to say that most insider leaks are accidental and not due to the activity of a malicious actor. An example is someone who leaves their laptop unlocked, opens a door for a stranger, or forwards an email accidentally to a wide audience. These actions are not considered malicious, but can leave an organization exposed to sensitive data leaks.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000885"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The numbers vary on insider threats since not everything is required to be reported. However, Ponemon Institute produced the “2020 Cost of Insider Threats: Global Report” that showed that criminal insiders accounted for around 23% of insider incidents and 14% were due to criminals posing as insiders. These types of attacks are usually thought of as a problem for the information security team to deal with, but keep in mind that software engineering teams not only have access to the organization’s intellectual property in the form of proprietary code, but also usually have elevated rights to environments that may have sensitive information.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1000894"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The motivations for an insider can vary. As mentioned, some leaks at the hands of an insider are accidental. This is due to the lack of controls around access to information like a lack of proper segmentation or a least privilege model that enforces access to only those that need it. Controls should also be in place to guarantee that sensitive data and production data is not able to be moved from a production environment to another location. When motivation is to take revenge on the organization for a perceived slight, this becomes more complicated to defend.

His famous reply supposedly is, “Because that’s where the money is.” Turns out that may not have been totally accurate according to Willie Sutton himself and was perhaps just an editor attempting to be pithy.

One of the most widely recognized application security projects is the OWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks. This documents the top ten most impactful security risks that a web application faces (</span><a href="https://owasp.org/" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentalink" style="text-decoration:underline">https://owasp.org/</span></a><span class="css-zv7ju9" style="color:#3d3b49">).</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001156"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Using the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology, the measured risk comes down to a simple equation:</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001165"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Risk = Likelihood * Impact</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001177"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The likelihood is calculated by asking questions related to the threat agent and the found vulnerability. More on this in a bit. The aim of these questions is to uncover how likely an exploitation of the found vulnerability may be. With the impact calculation, there are another eight questions that are geared toward identifying what will happen to the organization and technology should the exploit be successful. This will lead you to the ultimate rating of the risk, which allows you to prioritize and apply the appropriate controls to eliminate or mitigate the risk properly. Before diving into the risk rating methods with OWASP, it’s important to call out that once a risk has been rated, there are several things that an organization can then do with that information and that risk.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-1001195"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">2.7.1 Remediate, mitigate, accept</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001207"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">In </span><a name="marker-1013340"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">general, </span><a name="marker-1013353"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">there are three methods to managing an identified risk.

To remediate this risk, the organization will need to perform regular testing through tools and penetration tests to identify opportunity of code injection into the forms they use. They will monitor traffic and create an allowlist that allows only outbound traffic to known good locations. Additionally, they may look to leverage subresource integrity (</span><a name="marker-1013392"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">SRI</span><a name="marker-1013379"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">) tags to create a hash of content that is used by the application and fetched by the browser so that it can determine whether the content has been tampered with.

This can also be considered reducing the risk since it may not completely eliminate it, but instead makes it less likely and raises the bar for an attacker. In most cases, mitigation involves using additional tools like a WAF or by reducing the size of the attack surface by limiting the audience down to as few accounts as possible and monitoring those accounts closely. Again, the goal of mitigation is not to eliminate, if this isn’t possible, but to reduce the attack surface to as small as possible.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001249"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">The last option is to accept the open risk. This is a less-than-ideal option, as it means that the organization is aware of the risk but has chosen to leave it open and accept it. This should still be coupled with risk reduction so that the risk is as minimal as possible. A prime example of where risk is accepted is in the case of an older application that simply cannot be shut down. It may be due to the fact that the organization has been unsuccessful in getting clients to move to a new product or a new version of the given application, but whatever the case is, the organization requires the risk to remain open due to a business decision. In many cases, the acceptance of risk is taken when the impact to the business is low. In other words, the business is willing to accept a breach and knows that the total cost to the business would be low.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001258"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">There are other facets of risk that can come into play such as cyber insurance and risk transfer.

This could come through due to the nature of the organization, the type of application in use, or geopolitical factors. Risk is ever evolving and may even be eliminated by doing nothing, as both risk and technology changes.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001288"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">This is where knowledge of your threat actors (adversaries), a well-documented architecture, and strong knowledge of how your application is deployed and used will come in handy. Identifying risk can come from conversations with the business and technical people within the organization, it can be made apparent by a client who reports a risk they identified, it can come from fellow industry partners, or it can come from your internal tools. Regardless of the method of risk identification, the most important part is to know you have risk.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="pgfId-1001297"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">In the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology, there are scores associated with each component. The higher the score, the higher the risk. When performing a risk rating, it is important to have the right resources involved with the measurement. This includes not just technical resources, but also business resources that understand what the impact to the business and organization would be for a given risk. Measuring of the risk can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the resources involved and the complexity of the risk. It is also important to highlight that much of the risk rating is subjective, where, depending on the resources involved, it is easy to go down a rabbit hole on conversations over the risk. An example of this is where participants in the process may differ on their perception of the risk or aspects of the mitigations that are available. Key to success here is to lay out ground rules, have previous examples handy, and keep the participants </span><a name="marker-1013457"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">on </span><a name="marker-1013470"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">topic.</span></p><div style="margin-right:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contenth3" style="margin-left:40.5pt; text-indent:-40.5pt"><a name="pgfId-1001306"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">2.7.3 Estimating likelihood</span></p></div><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt; margin-left:30pt; margin-bottom:18pt; background-color:#ffffff"><a name="marker-1013509"></a><a name="pgfId-1001318"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">Likelihood </span><a name="marker-1013483"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">is </span><a name="marker-1013496"></a><span class="css-zv7ju9">as simple as identifying when a risk may be exploited. We are all familiar with the statistics around driving a vehicle and the likelihood of a potential accident. Although many of us are aware of this risk, it doesn’t stop us from getting into our vehicles on a regular basis. It’s a risk we are willing to or need to take. The bottom line is that we never know when or even if an accident will occur on a commute to the office or another location; we simply know that statistically it may occur. Additionally, certain factors come in to play with this analogy. How fast we drive, other vehicles on the road, the safety of the route to our destination, and so on. The same applies with understanding the likelihood of a security risk. OWASP gives us eight factors for the threat actor and the vulnerability to help us measure the likelihood. The scores associated with each item is a weight that represents the impact of that item. This is used in the final calculation of the actual risk.

After some research, she knows that this issue is significant; however, completing a risk rating will help her prioritize the issue with the engineering team.

For this example, the ability to perform a successful attack requires moderate skill for a big reward in the form of stealing credit card information. The threat actor category would be cybercriminals and would be generally widespread. For the vulnerability itself, the ability to act on it is determined by the fact that automated tools are available to not only detect but to also create the script that can be used for the attack.

Looking at this particular risk, the loss of confidentiality is high because the threat actor can gain credit card information. There is no impact to integrity, or availability. Accountability would be difficult since the attacker can perform this attack without being known to the application. For the business impact, this would be significant given that if this is not well detected, it could go on for a long period of time before being noticed. Although financial impact would be low, the reputational and compliance impacts would be high, as would the possibility of this being a privacy violation, depending on what information would be stolen.</span></p><p class="book-contentsbo-rt-contentp" style="margin-right:30pt;

The likelihood of occurrence and the impact are both medium. However, the business impact is high. This allows Superior Products to take the approach that although there is a lower technical impact, the cost of the risk to the business is high and they would approach the resolution differently.

It looks at the risk from the point of view of whether the given platform has the appropriate level of security controls to host specific data. The input into an RRA is a data flow diagram that includes the type of data that is used by the service being assessed, as well as an understanding or documentation, of how the service works. From here, the process is similar to a threat model (we’ll talk about these later) where basic discussions occur on the service and its purpose. Data is highlighted with attention on how it’s stored and used. Then a methodical approach is taken to review possible threat scenarios that focus on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.
